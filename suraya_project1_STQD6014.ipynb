Excerpts from Sir Clinton's Notebook\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter I\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dying Man\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood pushed his chair back from the dinner-table. A glance at\\r\\nthe clock on the mantelpiece told him that on this evening he had been\\r\\neven later than usual in getting home for dinner. The expression in\\r\\nhis eyes showed that he had gone short of sleep for some time past;\\r\\nand when he rose to his feet, every movement betrayed his over-tired\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring my coffee to the study, please, Shenstone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nyou might take the telephone in there as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the hall wearily, switched on the study lights, and stood\\r\\nfor a moment on the threshold as if undecided what to do. A bright\\r\\nfire burned on the hearth; the heavy pile of the carpet was soft to\\r\\nhis feet; and the big saddlebag armchairs spoke to him of pure\\r\\nphysical comfort and relaxation after the strain of the day. He moved\\r\\nover to a table, hesitated again, and then picked up a copy of the\\r\\n_B.M.J._ in its postal wrapper. Taking a cigar from a box on the\\r\\ntable, he clipped it mechanically and sat down in one of the chairs by\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nShenstone drew a small table to Dr. Ringwood's elbow and placed the\\r\\ncoffee on it; then, retiring for a moment, he returned with the\\r\\ntelephone, which he plugged to a connection in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring it over here, Shenstone. I want to be sure that the bell will\\r\\nwake me if I happen to doze.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShenstone did as he was ordered and was about to leave the room when\\r\\nDr. Ringwood spoke again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFog clearing off, by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShenstone shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. Worse now than when you came in. Very thick indeed, sir. One\\r\\ncan't see even the nearest street lamp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood nodded gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's to be hoped no one wants me to go out this evening. Difficult\\r\\nenough to find one's way about a strange town in the daytime with a\\r\\nfog like this over everything. But in the daytime there are always\\r\\npeople about who can give you some help. Nobody bar policemen will be\\r\\nout to-night, I should think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShenstone's face showed his sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery difficult for you, sir. If there's a night call, perhaps you'd\\r\\nknock me up, sir, and I could go out with you and help you to find\\r\\nyour way. I'd be quite glad to do it, sir, if I could be of any\\r\\nservice. When Dr. Carew went into the nursing home he specially\\r\\nimpressed on me that I was to give you every assistance I could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA tired smile crossed Dr. Ringwood's face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoubtful if you can see any further through pea-soup than I can\\r\\nmyself, Shenstone. Half the time, as I was coming back for dinner, I\\r\\ncouldn't see even the pavement; so I'm afraid your local knowledge\\r\\nwouldn't give you much of a pull. Thanks all the same. I've got a map\\r\\nof the town and I'll try to find my way by it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, and then, as Shenstone turned to go, he added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut a decanter\\xe2\\x80\\x94Scotch\\xe2\\x80\\x94and some soda on the table over yonder. Then I\\r\\nshan't need to worry you again to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Shenstone left the room, Dr. Ringwood tore open the wrapper of the\\r\\n_B.M.J._, threw the paper into the fire, and unfolded the journal. He\\r\\nscanned the contents while sipping his coffee; but in a few minutes\\r\\nthe bulky magazine slipped down on to his knees and he resigned\\r\\nhimself completely to the comfort of his surroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank the Lord I didn't need to become a G.P.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reflected.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpecialism's a tough enough row to hoe, but general practice is a\\r\\ndog's life, if this is a sample of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the _B.M.J._ again; but as he did so his sharp ear caught\\r\\nthe sound of the front door bell. An expression of annoyance crossed\\r\\nhis features and deepened as he heard Shenstone admit some visitor. In\\r\\na few seconds the door of the study opened and Shenstone announced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Trevor Markfield, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood's face cleared as a clean-shaven man of about thirty\\r\\nentered the room; and he rose from his chair to greet the newcomer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome in, Trevor. Try that pew beside the fire. I've been meaning to\\r\\nring you up ever since I came last week, but I haven't had a moment.\\r\\nThis 'flu epidemic has kept me on the run.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor Markfield nodded sympathetically as he moved towards the fire\\r\\nand extended his hands to the blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd have looked you up before, but it was only this morning I heard\\r\\nfrom someone that you were doing _locum_ for old Carew. It's a bit out\\r\\nof your line, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCarew's an old friend of ours; and when he went down with\\r\\nappendicitis he asked me in a hurry to look after his practice and I\\r\\ncould hardly refuse. It's been an experience, of sorts. I haven't had\\r\\ntwo hours continuous sleep in the last five days, and I feel as if the\\r\\nnext patient runs the risk of a free operation. I'm fit to bite him in\\r\\nthe gizzard without an\\xc3\\xa6sthetics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's stern features relaxed slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs bad as all that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I don't mind real cases. But last night I was called out at two\\r\\nin the morning, when I'd just got back from a relapsed 'flu case. A\\r\\nsmall boy. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Dreadfully ill, doctor. Please come at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 When I got\\r\\nthere, it was simply an acute case of over-stuffing. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It was his\\r\\nbirthday, doctor, and of course we had to let him do as he liked on\\r\\nthat day.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 By the time I'd got there, he'd dree'd his weird\\xe2\\x80\\x94quite\\r\\nempty and nothing whatever the matter with him. No apologies for\\r\\ndragging me out of bed, of course. A doctor isn't supposed to have a\\r\\nbed at all. I expect the next thing will be a fatal case of ingrowing\\r\\ntoe-nails. It's a damned nuisance to have one's time frittered away on\\r\\nthat sort of thing when one's at one's wits end to do what one can for\\r\\npeople at the last gasp with something really dangerous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStill got the notion that human life's valuable? The war knocked that\\r\\non the head,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield commented, rubbing his hands together to warm\\r\\nthem. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuman life's the cheapest thing there is. It's a blessing I\\r\\nwent over to the scientific side, instead of going in for physicking.\\r\\nI'd never have acquired a good sympathetic bedside manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood made a gesture towards the decanter on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave a spot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he invited. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a miserable night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield accepted the offer at once, poured out half a tumblerful of\\r\\nwhisky, splashed in a very little soda, and drank off his glass with\\r\\nevident satisfaction. Putting down the tumbler, he moved across and\\r\\nsat down by the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's an infernal night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I didn't know this end of\\r\\nthe town like the palm of my hand, I'd have lost my way coming here.\\r\\nIt's the thickest fog I've seen for long enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm in a worse box, for I don't know the town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood pointed\\r\\nout. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we're not near the peak of this 'flu epidemic yet, by a long\\r\\nway. You're lucky to be on the scientific side. Croft-Thornton\\r\\nResearch Institute, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I came here three years ago, in 1925. Silverdale beat me for the\\r\\nhead post in the chemical department; they gave me the second place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood mused. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fellow who works on alkaloids?\\r\\nTurned out a new condensate lately as side-line? I seem to know the\\r\\nname.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's him. He doesn't worry me much. I dine at his house now and\\r\\nagain; but beyond that we don't see much of each other outside the\\r\\nInstitute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've a notion I ran across him once at a smoker in the old days. He\\r\\nplayed the banjo rather well. Clean-shaven, rather neatly turned out?\\r\\nHe'll be about thirty-five or so. By the way, he's married now, isn't\\r\\nhe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint expression of contempt crossed Markfield's face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, he's married. A French girl. I came across her in some\\r\\namateur theatricals after they arrived here. Rather amusing at first,\\r\\nbut a bit too exacting if one took her on as a permanency, I should\\r\\nthink. I used to dance with her a lot at first, but the pace got a bit\\r\\ntoo hot for my taste. A man must have some evenings to himself, you\\r\\nknow; and what she wanted was a permanent dancing-partner. She's taken\\r\\non a cub at the Institute\\xe2\\x80\\x94young Hassendean\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoesn't Silverdale do anything in that line himself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a damn. Hates dancing except occasionally. They're a weird\\r\\ncouple. Nothing whatever in common, that I can see; and they've\\r\\napparently agreed that each takes a separate road. You never see 'em\\r\\ntogether. She's always around with this Hassendean brat\\xe2\\x80\\x94a proper young\\r\\nsquib; and Silverdale's turned to fresh woods in the shape of Avice\\r\\nDeepcar, one of the girls at the Institute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSerious?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood inquired indifferently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect he'd be glad of a divorce, if that's what you mean. But I\\r\\ndoubt if he'll get it, in spite of all the scandal about Yvonne. If I\\r\\ncan read the signs, she's just keeping the Hassendean cub on her\\r\\nstring for her own amusement, though she certainly advertises her\\r\\nconquest all over the shop. He's not much to boast about: one of these\\r\\nyoung pseudo-romantic live-your-own-lifer's with about as much real\\r\\nbackbone as a filleted sole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bit rough on Silverdale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commented Dr. Ringwood apathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor Markfield's short laugh betrayed his scorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man's an ass to get tied up to a woman. Silverdale got caught by\\r\\none side of her\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh, she's very attractive on that side, undoubtedly.\\r\\nBut it didn't last, apparently, for either of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there you are!\\r\\nOutside their own line, women are no use to a man. They want too much\\r\\nof one's time if one marries them, and they're the very devil,\\r\\ngenerally. I've no sympathy with Silverdale's troubles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood, obviously bored, was seeking for a fresh subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cComfortable place, the Institute?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield nodded with obvious approval.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst-rate. They're prepared to spend money like water on equipment.\\r\\nI've just come in from the new Research Station they've put up for\\r\\nagricultural experiments. It's a few miles out of town. I've got a\\r\\nroom or two in it for some work I'm doing in that line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Dr. Ringwood could reply, the telephone bell trilled and with a\\r\\nstifled malediction he stepped over to the instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Ringwood speaking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the message came through, his face darkened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. I'll be round to see her shortly. The address is 26\\r\\nLauderdale Avenue, you say? . . . I'll come as soon as I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put down the telephone and turned to his guest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've got to go out, Trevor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou said 26 Lauderdale Avenue, didn't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalk of the\\r\\nDevil! That's Silverdale's house. Nothing wrong with Yvonne, is there?\\r\\nSprained her ankle, or what not, by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. One of the maids turned sick, it seems; and the other maid's a\\r\\nbit worried because all the family are out to-night and she doesn't\\r\\nknow what to do with her invalid. I'll have to go. But how I'll find\\r\\nmy way in a fog like this, is beyond me. Where is the place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout a couple of miles away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat'll take a bit of finding,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood grumbled, as he thought\\r\\nof the fog and his own sketchy knowledge of the local geography.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed to reflect for a moment or two before answering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell you what,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've got my car at the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94I'm\\r\\njust down from the Research Station. If you like, I'll pilot you to\\r\\nSilverdale's. I'll manage it better than you possibly could, on a\\r\\nnight like this. You can drive behind me and keep your eye on my\\r\\ntail-light. You could get home again all right, I expect; it's easier,\\r\\nsince you've only got to find your way to a main street and stick to\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood made no attempt to dissemble his relief at this solution\\r\\nof his difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's decent of you, Trevor. Just let me have a look at the map\\r\\nbefore we start. I'll take it with me, and I expect I'll manage to get\\r\\nhome again somehow or other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced ruefully round the comfortable room and then went to the\\r\\nwindow to examine the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThicker than ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll need to crawl through that\\r\\nfog.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes, Dr. Ringwood had put on his boots, warned Shenstone\\r\\nto attend to the telephone in his absence, and got his car out of the\\r\\ngarage. Meanwhile Markfield had started his own engine and was\\r\\nawaiting the doctor at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoot like blazes the moment you lose sight of me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he recommended.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I hear your horn I'll stop and hoot back. That should keep us in\\r\\ntouch if the worst comes to the worst.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe climbed into his driving-seat and started slowly down the road. Dr.\\r\\nRingwood fell in behind. The fog was denser than ever, and the\\r\\nheadlights of the cars merely illuminated its wreaths without piercing\\r\\nthem. As soon as his car had started, Dr. Ringwood felt that he had\\r\\nlost touch with all the world except the tail-light ahead of him, and\\r\\na few square feet of roadway immediately under his eyes. The kerb of\\r\\nthe pavement had vanished; no house-window showed through the mist.\\r\\nFrom time to time the pale beacon of a street-lamp shone high in the\\r\\nair without shedding any illumination upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the guiding tail-lamp almost disappeared from view. After that,\\r\\nhe crept up closer to the leading car, shifted his foot from the\\r\\naccelerator to the brake, and drove on the hand-throttle. His eyes\\r\\nbegan to smart with the nip of the fog and his throat was rasped as he\\r\\ndrew his breath. Even in the saloon the air had a lung-catching tang,\\r\\nand he could see shadows in it, thrown by the nimbus of the headlights\\r\\nin the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost from the start he had lost his bearings and now he pinned his\\r\\nwhole attention on Markfield's tail-lamp. Once or twice he caught\\r\\nsight of tram-lines beside his wheels and knew that they were in a\\r\\nmain thoroughfare; but this gave him only the vaguest information of\\r\\ntheir position. The sound-deadening quality of the vapour about him\\r\\ncompleted the sense of isolation. Except for the faint beat of his own\\r\\nengine, he seemed to be in a silent world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Markfield's horn surprised him, and he had to jam on his\\r\\nbrakes to avoid colliding with the car in front of him. A shadowy\\r\\nfigure, hardly to be recognised as human, moved past him to the rear\\r\\nand vanished in the fog-wreaths. Then once more he had to concentrate\\r\\nhis attention on the dim lamp ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Markfield's car slid softly alongside a pavement and came\\r\\nslowly to rest. Dr. Ringwood pulled up and waited until his guide got\\r\\ndown from his seat and came back to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're just at the turn into Lauderdale Avenue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood made no attempt to conceal his admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a pretty good bit of navigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't notice\\r\\nyou hesitate once in the whole trip.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've a fairly good head for locality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield returned carelessly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow all you have to do is to turn to the left about ten yards further\\r\\non. The numbering starts from this end of the road, and the even\\r\\nnumbers are on the left-hand side. The houses are villas with big\\r\\ngardens, so you've only got to keep count of the gates as you pass\\r\\nthem. Stick by the pavement and you'll see the motor-entrances easily\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThanks. I doubt if I'd have got here without you, Trevor. Now what\\r\\nabout the road home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome straight back along here. Cross three roads\\xe2\\x80\\x94counting this as No.\\r\\n1. Then turn to the right and keep straight on till you cross\\r\\ntram-lines. That'll be Park Road. Keep along it to the left till\\r\\nyou've crossed two more sets of tram-lines and then turn to the right.\\r\\nThat'll be Aldingham Street, at the Blue Boar pub. You'll find your\\r\\nway from there simply enough, I think. That's the easiest way home. I\\r\\nbrought you by a shorter route, but you'd never find it on a night\\r\\nlike this. See you again soon. 'Night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for more, Markfield strode off to his car and soon Dr.\\r\\nRingwood saw the red star, his only point of contact with the real\\r\\nworld, slip away from him and vanish in the fog. When it had gone, he\\r\\nlet his clutch in and began to grope his way laboriously along the\\r\\npavement-edge and into Lauderdale Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fog was as thick as ever, and he had some difficulty in detecting\\r\\neven the breaks at the edge of the pavement which indicated the\\r\\npositions of house-gates. The walls of the gardens were concealed\\r\\nbehind the climbing curtain of vapour. He counted seven entrances and\\r\\nwas well on the way to the next when suddenly the roar of a horn made\\r\\nhim lift his eyes to the spaces ahead; two golden discs shone almost\\r\\nupon him and only a wild wrench at the wheel saved him from a\\r\\ncollision as the strange car swept past on the wrong side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDamn their eyes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople like that should be\\r\\nhanged. No one has a right to go barging along at twenty miles an hour\\r\\non a night like this, hustling everyone out of their way. And on the\\r\\nwrong side of the road, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his swerve he had lost touch with the pavement and he now crept\\r\\nback to the left, steering in gently for fear of rubbing his tyres on\\r\\nthe kerb. Then he began counting the gates once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEight . . . Nine . . . Ten . . . Eleven . . . Twelve. It's the next\\r\\none.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed the next gate and drew up just beyond it. Then reflecting\\r\\nthat it was hardly safe to leave a car on the street in a night like\\r\\nthis, he got down from his seat and went across the pavement to open\\r\\nthe gate of the short drive leading up to the house. The entrance was\\r\\nclear, however, and he was about to return to his car when a thought\\r\\nstruck him and he lit a match to examine the pillar of the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo number, of course!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented in annoyance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIvy Lodge. This\\r\\nmust be the place, anyhow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to his car, he backed it past the gate and then drove in and\\r\\nup the carriage-way. Just in time, as he came near the front door, the\\r\\nlights of a standing car warned him and he pulled up short to avoid a\\r\\ncollision. Shutting off his engine, he got out and approached the\\r\\nhouse, passing a lighted window as he did so. The standing car was\\r\\nempty, and he climbed the steps to the front door, from which a light\\r\\nwas shining. After some searching he discovered the press-button and\\r\\nrang the bell. The fog seemed thicker than ever; and as he stood on\\r\\nthe steps and gazed out into it, he could see no lights except those\\r\\nof the empty motor and his own headlamps. The house seemed completely\\r\\nisolated from the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing impatient, as no one came to open the door, he rang again; and\\r\\nthen, after a shorter interval, he held his finger down on the button\\r\\nuntil it seemed impossible that anyone in the house could fail to hear\\r\\nthe sound of the bell. But still no one appeared. The lighted rooms\\r\\nand the waiting car convinced him that there must be someone on the\\r\\npremises; and once more he set the bell in action.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs its notes died away again, he bent towards the door and strained\\r\\nhis ears to catch any sound of movement within the building. At first\\r\\nhe heard nothing; but all at once something attracted his attention: a\\r\\nnoise like a muffled cough. Dr. Ringwood hesitated for only a moment\\r\\nor two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething damned queer about this house, it seems to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncommented inwardly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTechnically it's burglary, I suppose; but if the\\r\\ndoor's unlocked, I think I'd better go in and look round.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened as he turned the handle, and he stepped softly into\\r\\nthe hall. Everything seemed normal in the house. He could hear the\\r\\nticking of a grandfather's clock further back on the stairs; but the\\r\\nnoise which had first attracted his attention was not repeated. Gently\\r\\nclosing the door to shut out the fog, he stood for a moment listening\\r\\nintently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnybody here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded in a carrying voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no answer; but after a short time he heard again the sound\\r\\nwhich had puzzled him, evidently coming from the lighted room on the\\r\\nground floor. Half a dozen swift steps took him to the door which he\\r\\nflung open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God! What's wrong with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ejaculated, as his glance caught\\r\\nthe only occupant of the smoke-room into which he had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a chesterfield, a fair-haired young man was lying helpless. From\\r\\nthe red stain on the lips, Dr. Ringwood guessed at a h\\xc3\\xa6morrhage of the\\r\\nlungs; and the quantity of blood on the boy's shirt-front and the dark\\r\\npool on the carpet pointed to the severity of the attack. The youth's\\r\\neyes caught the newcomer, and he beckoned feebly to the doctor.\\r\\nRingwood crossed to the chesterfield and bent down. It hardly needed\\r\\nan expert to see that assistance had come too late. The sufferer made\\r\\nan effort, and the doctor stooped to catch the words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c. . . Caught me . . . pistol . . . shot . . . thought it was . . .\\r\\nall right . . . never guessed . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood bent closer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho was it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that broken and gasped-out message had been the victim's last\\r\\neffort. With the final word, a cough shook him; blood poured from his\\r\\nmouth; and he fell back among the cushions in the terminal convulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood saw the jaw drop and realised that he could be of no\\r\\nfurther service. Suddenly his weariness, accentuated by the strain of\\r\\nthe drive through the fog, descended upon him once more. He\\r\\nstraightened himself with something of an effort and gazed down at the\\r\\nbody, feeling himself curiously detached from this suddenly-emergent\\r\\nmystery, as though it were no direct concern of his. Then, in his own\\r\\ndespite, his cool medical brain began to work as though by some\\r\\nvolition independent of his own. He drew out his notebook and jotted\\r\\ndown the few disjointed words which he had caught, lest he should\\r\\nforget them later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill held by the rigour of his training, he stooped once more and\\r\\nmade a close examination of the body, discovering in the course of it\\r\\ntwo tiny tears in the dress shirt which evidently marked the entries\\r\\nof the bullets which had pierced the lungs. Then, his inspection\\r\\ncompleted, he left the body undisturbed, noted the time on his\\r\\nwrist-watch, and made a further jotting in his pocket-book.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he did so, a fresh idea crossed his mind. Had there been more\\r\\nmurders? What about the maids in the house? The one who had rung him\\r\\nup must have been somewhere on the premises, dead or alive. Possibly\\r\\nthe murderer himself was still lurking in the villa.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo tired to think of risk, Dr. Ringwood set himself to explore the\\r\\nhouse; but to his amazement he discovered that it was empty. Nowhere\\r\\ndid he see the slightest sign of anything which suggested a divergence\\r\\nfrom normal routine. The cloak-room showed that two men lived on the\\r\\npremises, since he noted hats of two different sizes on the pegs; and\\r\\nthere appeared to be three bedrooms in use, apart from the servants\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nrooms on the upper floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next step was obviously to ring up the police, he reflected. The\\r\\nsooner this affair was off his shoulders, the better. But at this\\r\\npoint there flashed across his mind the picture of a methodical and\\r\\npossibly slow detective who might even be suspicious of Ringwood\\r\\nhimself and wish to detain him till the whole affair was cleared up.\\r\\nThat would be a nuisance. Then a way out of the difficulty opened up\\r\\nbefore him. He remembered paying a visit on the previous night to a\\r\\nbutler down with 'flu. When he had seen the patient, the man's master\\r\\nhad come and made inquiries about the case; and Ringwood had been able\\r\\nto reassure him as to the man's condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was that chap's name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ringwood questioned his memory. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir\\r\\nClinton Something-or-other. He's Chief Constable or some such big bug.\\r\\nWhen in doubt, go to headquarters. He'll remember me, I expect; he\\r\\ndidn't look as if much slipped past him. And that'll save me from a\\r\\nlot of bother at the hands of underlings. What the devil was his name?\\r\\nSir Clinton . . . Driffield, that's it. I'll ring him up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced round the hall in which he was standing but saw no\\r\\ntelephone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's probably in the smoke-room where the body is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested to\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though he searched all the likely places in the house he was\\r\\nunable to find any instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey haven't a 'phone, evidently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he was driven to admit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in\\r\\nthat case, I can't be in Silverdale's house at all. This must be the\\r\\nwrong shop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he remembered the moment when the other car had swept down upon\\r\\nhim out of the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat probably explains it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I had to swerve out\\r\\nof his way, I must have missed one of the entrance gates before I got\\r\\nback in touch with the pavement again. If that's so, then obviously\\r\\nI'm in the wrong house. But whose house is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe re-entered the smoke-room and looked round in search of some clue.\\r\\nA writing-desk stood over against one of the walls, and he crossed to\\r\\nit and took up a sheet of paper from a note-paper case. The heading\\r\\nwas what he wanted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIvy Lodge, 28 Lauderdale Avenue, Westerhaven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's what happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reflected, with a faint satisfaction at\\r\\nhaving cleared the point up so simply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm next door to Silverdale's\\r\\nplace, evidently, I can 'phone from there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred to him that he had better be on the safe side and make\\r\\nsure of his information by adding the name of the householder when he\\r\\nrang up the Chief Constable. A fresh search among the pigeon-holes of\\r\\nthe desk produced a letter in its original envelope addressed to\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdward Hassendean, Esq.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood put it down again and racked\\r\\nhis memory for an association with the name. He had paid only the most\\r\\nperfunctory attention to Markfield's talk, earlier in the evening, and\\r\\nit was some seconds before his mind could track down the elusive data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHassendean! That was the name of the cub who was hanging round the\\r\\nskirts of Silverdale's wife, I believe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at the body on the chesterfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might be that youngster. The police will soon find out from the\\r\\ncontents of his pockets, I expect. Besides, the rest of the family\\r\\nwill be home soon. They must be out for the evening, and the maids\\r\\ntoo. That accounts for the house being empty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled out his pocket-book and scanned the note he had made of the\\r\\nboy's disjointed utterance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaught me . . . thought it was . . . all right . . . never\\r\\nguessed . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA flash of illumination seemed to pass across Dr. Ringwood's mind as\\r\\nhe re-read the words. In it he saw a frivolous wife, a dissolute boy,\\r\\nand a husband exasperated by the sudden discovery of an intrigue; a\\r\\nsordid little tragedy of three characters. That seemed to be a plain\\r\\nenough explanation of the miserable affair. Markfield's suspicions had\\r\\nclearly been fairly near the truth; if anything, they had fallen short\\r\\nof the real state of affairs. Something had precipitated the\\r\\nexplosion; and Dr. Ringwood idly speculated for a moment or two upon\\r\\nwhat could have led to the husband's enlightenment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he awoke to a fresh aspect of the affair. The Hassendean family\\r\\nwould be coming home again shortly, or else the maids would put in an\\r\\nappearance. The sooner the police were on the premises, the better. In\\r\\nthe meanwhile, it seemed advisable to prevent any disturbance of\\r\\nthings, if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood left the smoke-room, locked the door after him, and\\r\\nremoved the key, which he slipped into his pocket. Then, making sure\\r\\nthat the front door could be opened from the outside when he returned,\\r\\nhe went down the steps and out into the fog once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter II\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House Next Door\\r\\n\\r\\nThe box edging of the drive gave Dr. Ringwood sufficient guidance\\r\\nthrough the darkness down to the gate; and by following the garden\\r\\nwall thereafter, he had little difficulty in making his way to the\\r\\nentrance of No. 26. By the light of a match he read the name\\r\\n_Heatherfield_ on the gate-pillar, but here also there was no\\r\\ndistinguishing number. This time, however, there could be no mistake\\r\\nand he groped his way cautiously up the drive until the light over the\\r\\nfront door shone faintly through the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he went, a fresh complication in the situation presented itself to\\r\\nhis mind. What would be the effect if he blurted out the news of the\\r\\ntragedy at Ivy Lodge? If the maid at Silverdale's happened to be of a\\r\\nnervous type, she might take fright when she heard of the murder and\\r\\nmight refuse to be left alone in the house with only a sick companion.\\r\\nThat would be very awkward. Dr. Ringwood decided that his best course\\r\\nwould be to say nothing about the affair next door, and merely make\\r\\nsome simple excuse for going to the telephone. If he could shut\\r\\nhimself up while he telephoned, she would learn nothing; if not, then\\r\\nhe would need to invent some pretext for getting her out of the way\\r\\nwhile he communicated with the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe climbed the steps and pressed the bell-button. This time he was not\\r\\nkept waiting, for almost immediately the door opened and a middle-aged\\r\\nwoman, apparently a cook, peered nervously out at his figure framed in\\r\\nthe fog. Seeing a stranger before her, she kept the door almost\\r\\nclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that Dr. Ringwood?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as he nodded assent, she broke into a torrent of tremulous\\r\\nexplanation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you were never coming, doctor. It's such a responsibility\\r\\nbeing left with Ina upstairs ill and no one else in the house. First\\r\\nof all, she was headachy; then she was sick; and her skin's hot and\\r\\nshe looks all flushed. I think she's real ill, doctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll see about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood assured her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut first of all, I\\r\\nhave to ring up about another patient. You've a 'phone, of course? It\\r\\nwon't take me a minute; and it's important.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid seemed put out that he did not go straight to his patient;\\r\\nbut she led the way to the cloakroom where the telephone was fixed.\\r\\nDr. Ringwood paused before going to the instrument. He bethought\\r\\nhimself of a pretext to get this nervous creature out of earshot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may need some boiling water\\xe2\\x80\\x94a small jug of\\r\\nit. Can you go and put on a kettle now, so that it'll be ready if I\\r\\nwant it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid went off towards the kitchen, whereupon he closed the door\\r\\nbehind him and rang up. To his relief, Sir Clinton Driffield was at\\r\\nhome; and in less than a couple of minutes Dr. Ringwood was able to\\r\\ntell his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Dr. Ringwood speaking, Sir Clinton. You may remember me; I'm\\r\\nattending your butler.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing wrong in the case, I hope?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it's not that. I was called here\\xe2\\x80\\x94Heatherfield, 26 Lauderdale\\r\\nAvenue, this evening. I'm Dr. Carew's _locum_ and a stranger in\\r\\nWesterhaven; and in this fog I went to the wrong house\\xe2\\x80\\x94the one next\\r\\ndoor to here: Ivy Lodge, 28 Lauderdale Avenue. Mr. Hassendean's house.\\r\\nThe place was lit up and a car was at the door; but I got no answer\\r\\nwhen I rang the bell. Something roused my suspicions and I went\\r\\ninside. The house was empty: no maids or anyone on the premises. In a\\r\\nsmoke-room on the ground floor I found a youngster of about twenty-two\\r\\nor so, dying. He'd been shot twice in the lung and he died on my hands\\r\\nalmost as I went in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused; but as Sir Clinton made no comment, Dr. Ringwood continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe house hadn't a telephone. I came in here, after locking the\\r\\nsmoke-room door. I've a patient to see in this house. How long will it\\r\\ntake your people to get to Ivy Lodge and take charge?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll be over myself in twenty minutes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton replied.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProbably the local police will be there about the same time. I'll\\r\\nring them up now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. I'll see to my patient here; and then I'll go back to Ivy\\r\\nLodge to wait for you. Someone ought to be on the premises in case the\\r\\nmaids or the family come home again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight. I'll be with you shortly. Good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood, glancing at his watch, saw that it was twenty minutes\\r\\npast ten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey ought to be here about a quarter to eleven, if they can find\\r\\ntheir way in that fog,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reflected.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the cloakroom, he made his way to the nearest sitting-room and\\r\\nrang the bell for the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe water will be boiling in a minute or two, doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she announced,\\r\\ncoming from the back premises. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you need it before you go up to\\r\\nsee Ina, or shall I bring it up to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may not need it at all. Show me the way, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe led him up to the patient's room and waited while he made his\\r\\nexamination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, doctor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded when he came out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's got scarlatina, I'm afraid. Rather a bad attack. She ought to\\r\\nbe taken to hospital now, but on a night like this I doubt if the\\r\\nhospital van could get here easily. Have you had scarlet yourself, by\\r\\nany chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, doctor. I had it when I was a child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood nodded, as though contented by the information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you don't run much risk of taking it from her. That simplifies\\r\\nthings. I'd rather not shift her to-night, just in case the van lost\\r\\nits way. But if you can look after her for a few hours, it will be all\\r\\nright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid did not seem altogether overjoyed at this suggestion. Dr.\\r\\nRingwood sought for some way out of the difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's nobody at home to-night, is there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. Mr. Silverdale hasn't been home since lunch-time, and Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale went out immediately after dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen will she be back?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot till late, sir, I expect. Young Mr. Hassendean came to dinner,\\r\\nand they went off in his car. I expect they've gone to the Alhambra to\\r\\ndance, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood repressed his involuntary movement at the name\\r\\nHassendean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen in doubt, play the medicine-man card,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he concluded swiftly in\\r\\nhis mind, without betraying anything outwardly. It seemed possible\\r\\nthat he might get some evidence out of the maid before she became\\r\\nconfused by any police visit. He assumed an air of doubt as he turned\\r\\nagain to the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Mrs. Silverdale come much in contact with the housemaid during\\r\\nthe day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. Hardly at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! When did Mrs. Silverdale have dinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt half-past seven, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas this Mr. Hassendean here long before dinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. He came in a few minutes before the half-hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere were they before dinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the drawing-room, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe maid had been in that room during the day, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly just doing some dusting, sir. She had been complaining of a sore\\r\\nthroat and being out of sorts, and she didn't do anything she could\\r\\navoid bothering with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood shook his head as though he were not very easy in his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen Mrs. Silverdale and Mr. Hassendean went in to dinner? Did the\\r\\nhousemaid wait at dinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. By that time she was feeling very bad, so I sent her to bed\\r\\nand looked after the dinner myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe hadn't touched the dishes, or anything of that sort?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd immediately after dinner, Mrs. Silverdale and Mr. Hassendean went\\r\\nout?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid hesitated for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. At least\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood made his face grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me exactly what happened. One never can tell with these scarlet\\r\\ncases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, I was just going to bring in coffee when Mr. Hassendean\\r\\nsaid: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let's have our coffee in the drawing-room, Yvonne. This room's\\r\\na bit cold.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Or something like that. I remember he didn't want the\\r\\ncoffee in the dining-room, at any rate. So I went to get it; and when\\r\\nI came back with it they were sitting beside the fire in the\\r\\ndrawing-room. I was going to take the tray over to them, when Mr.\\r\\nHassendean said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Put it down on the table over there.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So I put it\\r\\ndown and went away to clear the dining-room table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the housemaid had dusted the drawing-room this morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr.\\r\\nRingwood said thoughtfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Hassendean wasn't long in the\\r\\ndrawing-room after dinner, was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. They didn't take very long over their coffee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood looked judicial and seemed to consider some abstruse\\r\\npoint before speaking again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Silverdale didn't look ill during the day, did she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. But now you mention it, I did think she seemed rather\\r\\nstrange just before she went out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed? I was afraid of something of the sort. What do you mean,\\r\\nexactly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood demanded, concealing his interest as well as he\\r\\ncould.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, it's hard to say exactly. She came out of the drawing-room\\r\\nand went upstairs to get her cloak; and as she came down again, I\\r\\npassed her in the hall, taking some dishes to the kitchen. She seemed\\r\\ndazed-like, now you mention it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDazed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFunny sort of look in her eyes, sir. I can't describe it well. Seemed\\r\\nas if she wasn't taking notice of me as I passed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood's face showed an increase in gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid Mrs. Silverdale may have got infected too. What about Mr.\\r\\nHassendean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid considered for a moment before answering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't notice anything strange about Mr. Hassendean, sir. Unless,\\r\\nperhaps, he _did_ seem a bit nervous\\xe2\\x80\\x94high-strung like, I thought. But\\r\\nI'd never have paid attention to it if you hadn't asked me the\\r\\nquestion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood made a gesture of approval, inwardly thanking his stars\\r\\nfor the lay public's ignorance of diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then they went off together?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Mr. Hassendean took the cloak from Mrs. Silverdale and put\\r\\nit over her shoulders. Then he took her arm and they went out to his\\r\\ncar. It was waiting in front of the door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! I suppose the housemaid hadn't touched the cloak to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sir. She'd been in Mrs. Silverdale's room, of course; but she\\r\\nwouldn't have any reason to go near the cloak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood feigned a difficulty in recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHassendean! I surely know him. Isn't he about my height, fair, with a\\r\\nsmall moustache?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. That's him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood had confirmed his guess. It was young Hassendean's body\\r\\nthat lay next door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may have to come back here in an hour or so.\\r\\nI'd like to have another look at my patient upstairs. Will Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale be back by that time, do you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would be about half-past eleven, sir? No, I don't think she'd be\\r\\nback as soon as that. She's usually out until after midnight, most\\r\\nnights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, you might sit up and wait for me, please. Go to bed if I'm not\\r\\nhere by twelve. But\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94 No, if you can manage it, I think you ought to\\r\\nkeep awake till Mrs. Silverdale comes home. That patient shouldn't be\\r\\nleft with no one to look after her. I'm just afraid she may get a\\r\\nlittle light-headed in the night. It's hard lines on you; but you must\\r\\ndo your best for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, sir, if you say so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps Mr. Silverdale will turn up. Is he usually late?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne never can tell with him, sir. Some days he comes home to dinner\\r\\nand works late in his study. Other times he's out of the house from\\r\\nbreakfast-time and doesn't get back till all hours. He might be here\\r\\nin five minutes now, or he mightn't come home till two in the\\r\\nmorning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood felt that he had extracted all the information he could\\r\\nreasonable expect to get. He gave the maid some directions as to what\\r\\nshe should do in possible emergencies; then, glancing at his watch, he\\r\\ntook his departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he went down the steps of the house, he found no signs of the fog\\r\\nlifting; and he had to exercise as much care as ever in making his way\\r\\nthrough it. He was not unsatisfied with the results of his\\r\\ninterrogation. Young Hassendean had met Silverdale's wife by\\r\\nappointment, evidently. They had dined together; and then they had\\r\\ngone away in the fog. Clearly enough, from what the maid said, both of\\r\\nthem were in a somewhat abnormal state when they left the house.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Dazed-like,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98a bit nervous\\xe2\\x80\\x94high strung.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He recalled the expressions\\r\\nwith a faint annoyance at the vagueness of the descriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed quite likely that, instead of going to a dance-hall, they\\r\\nhad simply driven round to Ivy Lodge, which young Hassendean must have\\r\\nknown to be empty at that time. And there, something had happened. The\\r\\ngirl had gone away or been taken away, and the youngster had been left\\r\\nto die. But where had Yvonne Silverdale gone?\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood opened the door of Ivy Lodge and took the key of the\\r\\nsmoke-room from his pocket. The house was silent as when he left it.\\r\\nEvidently no one had come home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton at Ivy Lodge\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood left the smoke-room door open to ensure that he would\\r\\nhear anyone who entered the house. He made a second cursory inspection\\r\\nof young Hassendean's body; but as he took care not to alter the\\r\\nposition of anything, he discovered no more than he had done when he\\r\\ninspected it originally. There seemed to be nothing further for him to\\r\\ndo until the police came upon the scene; so he picked out a\\r\\ncomfortable chair and let himself relax whilst he had the chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient next door worried him a little. Perhaps he ought to have\\r\\ngot the girl off to hospital at once, fog or no fog. It would be\\r\\nawkward if she turned delirious in the night. And from that, his mind\\r\\ndrifted to other cases which were giving him anxiety. With this 'flu\\r\\nepidemic, Carew's practice had been anything but the nice, quiet,\\r\\njog-trot business he had imagined it to be when he promised to come as\\r\\n_locum_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some incongruous linking, his thoughts came back to the events\\r\\nthrough which he had just passed. Death was all in the day's work for\\r\\na medical man, but he had hardly bargained for murder. At least, he\\r\\nhad hitherto assumed that this was a case of murder, but possibly it\\r\\nwas suicide. He recalled that he had not seen any pistol; and he felt\\r\\na momentary inclination to search the room for the weapon; but his\\r\\nfatigue was greater than his interest, and he abandoned the project.\\r\\nAfter all, it was an affair for the police, when they came to take\\r\\ncharge; it was no business of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, he could not shake off the subject of the tragedy; and,\\r\\ndespite himself, he began to speculate on the possibilities of the\\r\\nsituation. Suppose that, after dinner, young Hassendean and Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale had simply driven round to Ivy Lodge. That would account\\r\\nfor the empty car at the door. Then they must have come into the\\r\\nhouse. He had found the door unlocked, so that anyone could enter.\\r\\nThat seemed rather a peculiar point. Surely, if they had come here for\\r\\nthe only purpose which seemed covered by the case, they would have\\r\\ntaken the obvious precaution of closing the front door against\\r\\nintruders. But if they had done that, how could Silverdale have got\\r\\nin? He could hardly have had a latch-key for his neighbours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred to Dr. Ringwood that possibly Silverdale might have gained\\r\\nadmittance through some unlatched window. He might have seen something\\r\\nthrough the smoke-room window and got into the house like a burglar.\\r\\nBut all the curtains were tightly drawn. No one could see in from the\\r\\noutside, even if they had wished to do so. Obviously, then, it could\\r\\nnot have been a chance discovery of his wife's guilt that had roused\\r\\nSilverdale to the pitch of murder. He must have had his suspicions and\\r\\ndeliberately tracked down the guilty couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost against his will, Dr. Ringwood's mind persisted in an attempt\\r\\nto reconstruct the happenings of the night. Suppose Silverdale got\\r\\nin\\xe2\\x80\\x94no matter how\\xe2\\x80\\x94then evidently he must have surprised the two; and\\r\\nthe end of that business had been the shooting of young Hassendean.\\r\\nBut that left Yvonne Silverdale and her husband still unaccounted for.\\r\\nHad she fled into the night before Silverdale could shoot her in her\\r\\nturn. Or had her husband forced her to go with him\\xe2\\x80\\x94whither? And if\\r\\nthis were the truth of the matter, why had Silverdale not locked the\\r\\ndoor? There seemed to be many things needing explanation before one\\r\\ncould feel that the case was clear. Well, that was the business of the\\r\\npolice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis train of thought was suddenly interrupted by the sound of feet at\\r\\nthe front door, and he pulled himself together with a start and rose\\r\\nfrom his chair. He was just moving towards the door when it opened and\\r\\nSir Clinton Driffield, accompanied by another man, entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood evening, Dr. Ringwood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable greeted him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nthink we've managed to get here at the time I promised, though it was\\r\\na difficult business with all this fog about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to introduce his companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Inspector Flamborough, doctor. He's in charge of the case.\\r\\nI'm merely here as an onlooker. I've given him the facts, so far as I\\r\\nknow them from you; but I expect that he may wish further information\\r\\nif you have any.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Sir Clinton's words, the mouth under Inspector Flamborough's\\r\\ntooth-brush moustache curved in a smile, half-friendly and\\r\\nhalf-inscrutable. Simultaneously, he seemed to be establishing good\\r\\nrelations with the doctor and appreciating some obscure joke in the\\r\\nChief Constable's remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's very lucky you're a medical man, sir. Death's all in the day's\\r\\nwork with you and me; neither of us is likely to be put off our\\r\\nbalance by it. Most witnesses in cases of this sort get so confused by\\r\\nthe shock that it's difficult to squeeze any clear story out of them.\\r\\nA doctor's different.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood was not particularly susceptible to flattery, but he\\r\\nrecognised that the Inspector probably was voicing his real\\r\\nsentiments. All three of them were experts in death, and among them\\r\\nthere was no need to waste time in polite lamentations. None of them\\r\\nhad ever set eyes on the victim before that night, and there was no\\r\\nobject in becoming sentimental over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down, doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton broke in, after a glance at the\\r\\nmedical man's face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou look as if you were about tired out. This\\r\\n'flu epidemic must be taking it out of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood did not wait to be asked twice. Sir Clinton followed his\\r\\nexample, but the Inspector, pulling a notebook from his pocket,\\r\\nprepared to open his investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see, now, doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began pleasantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd like to start from\\r\\nthe beginning. You might tell us just how you happened to come into\\r\\nthe business; and if you can give us some definite times, it'll be a\\r\\ngreat help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood nodded, but seemed to hesitate for a moment before\\r\\nreplying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I could give you it clearest if I were sure of one thing\\r\\nfirst. I believe that's the body of young Hassendean who lived in this\\r\\nhouse, but I haven't examined it closely\\xe2\\x80\\x94didn't wish to disturb it in\\r\\nany way before you turned up. If it is young Hassendean's body, then I\\r\\ncan fit some other things into my evidence. Perhaps you'll have a look\\r\\nfor yourselves and see if you can identify him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector exchanged a glance with his superior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as you please, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the room, knelt beside the chesterfield, and began to\\r\\nsearch the pockets in the body's clothes. The first two yielded\\r\\nnothing in the way of identification, but from one of the pockets of\\r\\nthe evening waistcoat the Inspector fished out a small card.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeason ticket for the Alhambra,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported, after glancing over it.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're right, doctor. The signature's here: Ronald Hassendean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was pretty sure of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I like to be\\r\\ncertain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector rose to his feet and came back to the hearthrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, perhaps, sir, you'll tell us the story in your own way. Only\\r\\nlet's have it clear. I mean, tell us what you saw yourself and let's\\r\\nknow when you're bringing anything else in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood had a clear mind and could put his facts together in\\r\\nproper order. In spite of his physical weariness, he was able to take\\r\\neach incident of the evening in its proper turn and make it fit neatly\\r\\ninto its place in his narrative. When he had finished, he had brought\\r\\nthe story up to the point when the police arrived. As he closed his\\r\\ntale, the Inspector shut his notebook with a nod of approval.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's a lot of useful information there, doctor. We're lucky in\\r\\nhaving your help. Some of what you've told us would have cost a lot of\\r\\nbother to fish out of different people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton rose to his feet with a gesture which invited the doctor\\r\\nto remain in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca good deal of your story is\\r\\nlike What the Soldier Said\\xe2\\x80\\x94it isn't first-hand evidence. We'll have to\\r\\nget it for ourselves, again, from the people who gave it to you: Dr.\\r\\nMarkfield and this maid next door. That's only routine; and doesn't\\r\\nimply that we disbelieve it in the slightest, naturally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood agreed with a faint smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI prefer getting a patient's symptoms at first-hand myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThings do get distorted a bit in the re-telling. And some of what I\\r\\ngave you is quite possibly just gossip. I thought you ought to hear\\r\\nit; but most certainly I don't guarantee its accuracy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector beamed his approval of the doctor's views.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, glancing at Sir Clinton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'd better\\r\\ngo over the ground here and see if there's anything worth picking up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suited the action to the word, and began a systematic search of the\\r\\nroom, commenting aloud from time to time for his companions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no pistol here, unless it's hidden away somewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreported after a while. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe murderer must have taken it away with\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face took on a quizzical expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust one suggestion, Inspector. Let's keep the facts and the\\r\\ninferences in separate boxes, if you please. What we really _do_ know\\r\\nis that you haven't found any pistol up to the present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's grin showed that the Chief Constable's shot had gone\\r\\nhome without wounding his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Pistol _or pistols_, not found.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I'll note that\\r\\ndown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went down on hands and knees to examine the carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's something fresh, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe carpet's so dark\\r\\nthat I didn't notice it before. The pattern concealed it, too. But\\r\\nhere it is, all right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew his fore-finger over the fabric at a spot near the door, and\\r\\nthen held it for their inspection, stained with an ominous red.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA blood-spot, and a fair-sized one, too! There may be more of them\\r\\nabout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Clinton mildly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI noticed some on the hall-carpet as\\r\\nI came in. There's a trail of them from the front door into this room.\\r\\nPerhaps you didn't see them; they're not conspicuous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector looked a trifle crestfallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you've a sharp eye, sir. I didn't spot them myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose we finish up this room before going elsewhere. All the\\r\\nwindows are fast, are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough examined them and reported that all the catches were on.\\r\\nThen he gazed up and down the room inquisitively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooking for bullet-holes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton questioned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite right. But\\r\\nyou won't find any.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like to be certain about things, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo do I, Inspector. So does Dr. Ringwood, if you remember. Well, you\\r\\ncan be certain of one thing. If two shots had been fired in here this\\r\\nevening, and if all the windows had been left closed as they are now,\\r\\nthen I'd have smelt the tang of the powder in the air when we came in.\\r\\nI didn't. Ergo, no shots were fired in this room. Whence it follows\\r\\nthat it's no use hunting for bullet-holes. Does that chain of\\r\\nreasoning satisfy you, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough made a gesture of vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ought to have thought of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we've got the main points, now, so far as this room itself\\r\\ngoes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton observed, without paying any heed to the\\r\\nInspector's annoyance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you mind examining the body, doctor,\\r\\njust to confirm your view that he was shot in the lung?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood assented and, crossing over, he subjected young\\r\\nHassendean's body to a careful scrutiny. A few minutes sufficed to\\r\\nprove that the only wounds were those in the chest; and when the\\r\\ndoctor had satisfied himself that his earlier diagnosis was correct,\\r\\nhe turned to the Chief Constable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no certainty without a P.M., of course, but from the way the\\r\\nbullets have gone in, it's pretty obvious that the shots took effect\\r\\non the left lung. There's very little external bleeding, apparently;\\r\\nand that rather looks as if one of the intercostal arteries may be\\r\\ninvolved. He must have bled a lot internally, I suspect. Probably the\\r\\nP.M. will confirm that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton accepted the verdict without demur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you make out of things, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded, turning\\r\\nto Flamborough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, with these small-calibre pistols, it's difficult to give\\r\\nmore than a guess. So far as I can see, it looks as if the pistol had\\r\\nbeen quite close-up when it was fired. I think I can see something\\r\\nthat looks like scorching or discoloration on his dress shirt round\\r\\nabout the wound, though the blood makes it hard to be sure. That's\\r\\nreally as far as I'd like to go until I've had a better chance of\\r\\nexamining the thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton turned back to the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose a wound in the lung may produce death at almost any length\\r\\nof time after the shot's actually fired. I mean that a man may live\\r\\nfor quite a long while even with a wound like this and might be able\\r\\nto move about to some extent after being shot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood had no hesitation in agreeing with this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe might have lived for an hour or two\\xe2\\x80\\x94even for days. Or else, of\\r\\ncourse, he might have collapsed almost at once. You never can tell\\r\\nwhat will happen in lung wounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed to give this a certain consideration. Then he moved\\r\\ntowards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll take up the blood-trail now. You'd better switch off the light\\r\\nand lock the door, Inspector. We don't want anyone blundering in here\\r\\nand getting a fright by any mischance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went out into the hall, where Sir Clinton drew the attention of\\r\\nthe Inspector to the traces of blood which he had noticed on the\\r\\ncarpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we'd better have a look at that car outside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they descended the steps from the front door, the Inspector took a\\r\\nflash-lamp from his pocket and switched it on. Its rays merely served\\r\\nto light up the fog; and it was not until they came almost to the side\\r\\nof the car that they could see much. The Inspector bent across, rubbed\\r\\nhis finger over the driving-seat, and then examined his hand in the\\r\\nlight of the lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome more blood there, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cleaned away the marks on his finger-tip and proceeded to explore\\r\\nthe other seats in the same manner. The results were negative. Apart\\r\\nfrom one or two spots on the running-board at the driving-seat door,\\r\\nthe car seemed otherwise clean. Inspector Flamborough straightened\\r\\nhimself up and turned to Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems that he must have driven the car back himself, sir. If\\r\\nsomeone else had done the driving, the blood would have been on some\\r\\nof the other seats instead of this one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton acquiesced with a gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose that's possible, doctor? A wound in the lung wouldn't\\r\\nincapacitate him completely?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would depend entirely on the sort of wound it was. I see nothing\\r\\nagainst it, _prima facie_. Driving a car isn't really much strain on\\r\\nthe body muscles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton ran his eye over the lines of the car in the light of the\\r\\nside-lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's an Austin, so he'd be able to get the engine going with the\\r\\nself-starter, probably, even on a night like this. He wouldn't need to\\r\\ncrank up the car. There would be no exertion on his part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector had been examining the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's frozen fairly hard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no hope of tracing\\r\\nthe car's track on a night like this, even if one could have done that\\r\\nthrough all the marks of the town traffic. That's a blank end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may as well take the number, Inspector. It's just possible that\\r\\nsome constable may have noticed it, though the chances are about a\\r\\nthousand to one against that, on a night of this sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough went round to the rear number-plate and jotted down the\\r\\nfigures in his pocket-book, repeating them aloud as he did so:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGX.6061.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came round the car again and subjected the whole interior to a\\r\\nminute scrutiny under the light of his flashlamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's a girl's handkerchief lying on the floor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as he\\r\\npeered down at the place beside the driver. Then, holding it in the\\r\\nlight from the side-lamp, he turned it over and reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's got \\xe2\\x80\\x98Y.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 embroidered in one corner. That would be for Yvonne\\r\\nSilverdale, I suppose. It doesn't take us much further. Except that it\\r\\nproves this was the car she went off in with young Hassendean, and I\\r\\nexpect we could have got better proof of that elsewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing else you can find?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Chief Constable could say anything further, two figures\\r\\nloomed up through the fog and a startled exclamation in a female voice\\r\\nreached the group around the car. Sir Clinton caught Dr. Ringwood's\\r\\narm and whispered hurriedly in his ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe maids coming back to the house. Spin them a yarn that young\\r\\nHassendean's met with an accident and been brought home. Tell them who\\r\\nyou are. We don't want to have them in hysterics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood moved towards the dim figures in the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm Dr. Ringwood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you're the maids, aren't\\r\\nyou? You must go in very quietly. Young Mr. Hassendean's had a bad\\r\\naccident and mustn't be disturbed. He's in the room to the right as\\r\\nyou go in at the door, so don't make a fuss in the house. You'd better\\r\\nget off to bed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sound of rapid whispering and then one of the maids\\r\\nenquired:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it a motor accident, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood, anxious not to commit himself to details, made a gesture\\r\\nto the window behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't make a row, please. Mr. Hassendean mustn't be disturbed in any\\r\\nway. Get off to bed as soon as you can, and keep quiet. By the way,\\r\\nwhen do you expect the rest of the family home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey've gone out to play bridge, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered the maid who had\\r\\nspoken before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsually they get home about half-past eleven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood. I shall have to wait for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bolder of the two maids had advanced as he was speaking, and now\\r\\nshe stared suspiciously at him in the dim light from the car lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she ventured. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do I know that it's all right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean I might be a burglar, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood answered\\r\\npatiently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, here's Inspector Flamborough. He's surely protection\\r\\nenough for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid examined Flamborough with relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, that's all right, sir. I saw Inspector Flamborough once at the\\r\\npolice sports. That's him, right enough. I'm sorry to have been a bit\\r\\nsuspicious, sir\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood reassured her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, just get off to bed,\\r\\nwill you. We've got the patient to think about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it a bad accident, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery serious, perhaps. Talking won't mend it, anyhow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood's temper was becoming slightly frayed by the maid's\\r\\npersistence. However, she took the hint and retired with her companion\\r\\ninto the house. Inspector Flamborough made a gesture which arrested\\r\\nthem at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, when did young Mr. Hassendean leave the house to-night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI couldn't say, sir. We left ourselves at seven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. Mr.\\r\\nHassendean and Miss Hassendean were just going out then\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were\\r\\ndining out. And Mr. Ronald was dressing, I think. He was going out to\\r\\ndinner, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough dismissed them, and they vanished into the hall. Sir\\r\\nClinton gave them a reasonable time to get out of the way before\\r\\nmaking any further move. The Inspector occupied himself with writing a\\r\\nnote in his pocket-book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we may as well go into the house again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable\\r\\nsuggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust fasten that front door after us, Inspector, if you\\r\\nplease. We may as well have some warning when the family turns up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led the way up the steps, entered the hall, and, after opening one\\r\\nor two doors at random, selected the drawing-room of the house, in\\r\\nwhich a banked-up fire was burning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may as well wait here. It's to be hoped they won't be long, now.\\r\\nSit down, doctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, noticing the expression on Dr. Ringwood's face, he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm sorry to detain you, doctor; but now we've got you, I think we'll\\r\\nhave to keep you until the Hassendeans come in. One never knows what\\r\\nmay turn up. They may have something to tell us which might need\\r\\nmedical checking and you've been too much of a gift from the gods to\\r\\npart with so long as there's a chance of our utilising you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood tried to make his acquiescence a cheerful one, though he\\r\\nwas thinking regretfully of his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's all in the day's work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm only a bit worried about\\r\\nthat case of scarlet next door. I'll have to look in there before I\\r\\ngo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo shall we,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce we've got all the evidence\\r\\nfrom the family, we'll need to ring up and get the body taken off to\\r\\nthe mortuary. You say we can telephone from the house next door?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. I had to go there to ring you up myself. The Hassendeans have no\\r\\n'phone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll go round with you then. . . . H'm! There's the door-bell,\\r\\nInspector. You'd better attend to it. Bring them in here, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough hurried out of the room; they heard some muffled talk\\r\\nbroken by ejaculations of surprise and horror; and then the Inspector\\r\\nushered Mr. and Miss Hassendean into the drawing-room. Dr. Ringwood\\r\\nwas unfavourably impressed at the first glance. Mr. Hassendean was a\\r\\nred-faced, white-haired man of about seventy, with a feebly blustering\\r\\nmanner. His sister, some five years younger, aped the air and dress of\\r\\nwomen twenty years her junior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat this? What's this, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hassendean demanded as he came into\\r\\nthe room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGod bless my soul! My nephew shot? What does it mean, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's what we should like to know, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Inspector Flamborough's\\r\\nquiet voice cut into the frothing torrent of the old man's eloquence.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're depending on you to throw some light on the affair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hassendean's voice seemed to strain itself in the vain\\r\\nattempt to express his feelings at the Inspector's suggestion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm\\r\\nnot a policeman, my good fellow; I'm a retired drysalter. God bless\\r\\nme! Do I look like Sherlock Holmes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, apparently unable to find words for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, look here, my good man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come home and I find you\\r\\noccupying my house, and you tell me that my young nephew has been\\r\\nshot. He's a good-for-nothing cub, I admit; but that's beside the\\r\\npoint. I want to know who's to blame for it. That's a simple enough\\r\\nquestion, surely. And instead of answering it, you have the nerve to\\r\\nask me to do your work for you! What do we pay police rates for, tell\\r\\nme that! And who are these men in my drawing-room? How did they come\\r\\nhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Sir Clinton Driffield; this is Dr. Ringwood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector\\r\\nanswered smoothly, taking no notice of Mr. Hassendean's other remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! I've heard of you, Sir Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hassendean acknowledged,\\r\\nless ungraciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, what about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe've met under rather unfortunate conditions, Mr. Hassendean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton admitted soothingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut they're none of our choosing, you\\r\\nknow. I quite understand your feelings; it must be a bad shock to come\\r\\nhome to an affair like this. But I hope you'll see your way to give us\\r\\nany information you have\\xe2\\x80\\x94anything that will assist us to get on the\\r\\ntrack of the person who shot your nephew. We really depend on you to\\r\\nhelp us at once, for every hour lost may make it more difficult to lay\\r\\nour hands on the criminal. Without knowing it, you may have the key to\\r\\nthe thing in your hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMore by his manner than by his words, the Chief Constable had\\r\\nsucceeded in pacifying the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if it's put like that, I don't mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he conceded, with a\\r\\nslight lessening in the asperity of his tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk your questions and\\r\\nI'll see what I can do for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood, watching the change in the situation, reflected\\r\\nsardonically to himself that a title had its uses when one came to\\r\\ndeal with a snob.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat old bounder was rude to the Inspector on principle; but when Sir\\r\\nClinton Driffield asks precisely the same question, he's quite\\r\\namenable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a type!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable, when he began his interrogatory, was careful not\\r\\nto betray that he already had some information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we'd better begin at the beginning, Mr. Hassendean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsuggested, with the air of one consulting a valued collaborator.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould you throw any light on your nephew's arrangements for this\\r\\nevening? Did he mean to stay in the house, or had he any outside\\r\\nengagement that you knew about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe told me he was going out to dinner with that hussy next door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's smile further disarmed old Hassendean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid you'll need to be more definite. There are so many hussies\\r\\nnowadays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're right there, sir! You're right there. I agree with you. I'm\\r\\nspeaking of the French one next door, her name's Silverdale. My nephew\\r\\nwas always hanging round her skirts, sir. I warned him against her,\\r\\noften enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always _knew_ something would happen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss Hassendean declared\\r\\nwith the air of a justified Cassandra. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now it _has_ happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton returned to the main track.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any idea if he meant to spend the evening next door?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hassendean interrupted before her brother could reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe mentioned to me that he was going with her to the Alhambra to\\r\\ndance. I remember that, because he actually asked me where I was going\\r\\nmyself to-night, which was unusual interest on his part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cScattering his money, of course!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her brother rapped out angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had money to scatter, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton asked casually. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must\\r\\nhave been lucky for his age.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason, this reflection seemed to stir a grievance in the old\\r\\nman's mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, he had about \\xc2\\xa3500 a year of his own. A very comfortable income\\r\\nfor a single young man. And I had to sit, sir, as his trustee; pay\\r\\nover the money quarterly to him; and see it wasted in buying jewellery\\r\\nand whatnot for that wench next door. I'm not a rich man, sir; and I\\r\\ngive you my word I could have spent it better myself. But I'd no\\r\\ncontrol over him, none whatever. I had to stand by and see all that\\r\\ngood money flung into the gutter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood turned aside to hide his smile at this revelation of the\\r\\ndrysalter's soul.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, who gets that money now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do, sir. And I hope I'll put it to better use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded in response to this sentiment, and seemed to ponder\\r\\nbefore he asked his next question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you can't think of anyone who might have had a grudge\\r\\nagainst him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man's glance showed some suspicion at the question; but his\\r\\nsister seemed to have less compunction, for she answered instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI warned Ronald again and again that he was playing with fire. Mr.\\r\\nSilverdale never took any open offence, but . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left her sentence unfinished. Sir Clinton seemed less impressed\\r\\nthan she had expected. He made no comment on her statement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I take it, Mr. Hassendean, that you can throw no light on the\\r\\naffair, beyond what you have told us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man seemed to think that he had given quite enough\\r\\ninformation, for he merely answered with a non-committal gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must thank you for your assistance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pursued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nunderstand, of course, that there are one or two formalities which\\r\\nneed to be gone through. The body will have to be removed for a _post\\r\\nmortem_ examination, I'm afraid; and Inspector Flamborough will need\\r\\nto go through your nephew's papers to see if anything in them throws\\r\\nlight on this affair. He can do that now, if you have no objections.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Hassendean seemed rather taken back by this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that necessary?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man's face bore all the marks of uneasiness at this decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd rather avoid it if possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not for use in\\r\\nCourt, is it? I shouldn't like that, not by any means. To tell you the\\r\\ntruth, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued in a burst of frankness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe didn't get on\\r\\nwell, he and I; and it's quite on the cards that he may have\\r\\nsaid\\xe2\\x80\\x94written, I mean\\xe2\\x80\\x94a lot of things about me that I shouldn't care to\\r\\nhave printed in the newspapers. He was a miserable young creature, and\\r\\nI never concealed my opinion about him. Under his father's will, he\\r\\nhad to live in my house till he was twenty-five, and a pretty life he\\r\\nled me, sir. I suspect that he may have slandered me in that diary he\\r\\nused to keep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'd better make a note about that diary, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nsuggested in a tone which seemed to indicate that Flamborough must be\\r\\ndiscreet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou needn't trouble yourself too much about it, Mr.\\r\\nHassendean. Nothing in it will come out in public unless it bears\\r\\ndirectly on this case; I can assure you of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drysalter recognised that this was final; but he could hardly be\\r\\ndescribed as giving in with a good grace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave it your own way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grunted crossly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton ignored this recrudescence of temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll leave the Inspector to see to things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll go\\r\\nwith Dr. Ringwood, Inspector, and do the telephoning. You'd better\\r\\nstay here, of course, until someone relieves you. You'll find plenty\\r\\nto do, I expect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bade good-night to his involuntary host and hostess and, followed\\r\\nby the doctor, left the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crime at Heatherfield\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a fine old turkey-cock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood commented, as he and Sir\\r\\nClinton groped their way down the drive towards the gate of Ivy Lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable smiled covertly at the aptness of the description.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe certainly did gobble a bit at the start,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that\\r\\ntype generally stops gobbling if you treat it properly. I shouldn't\\r\\ncare to live with him long, though. A streak of the domestic tyrant in\\r\\nhim somewhere, I'm afraid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood laughed curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must have been a pretty household,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he affirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn't get\\r\\nmuch valuable information out of him, in spite of all his\\r\\nself-importance and fuss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA character-sketch or two. Things like that are always useful when\\r\\none drops like a bolt from the blue into some little circle, as we\\r\\nhave to do in cases of this sort. I suppose it's the same in your own\\r\\nline when you see a patient for the first time: he may be merely a\\r\\nhypochondriac or he may be out of sorts. You've nothing to go on in\\r\\nthe way of past experience of him. We're in a worse state, if\\r\\nanything, because you can't have a chat with a dead man and find out\\r\\nwhat sort of person he was. It's simply a case of collecting other\\r\\npeople's impressions of him in a hurry and discarding about half that\\r\\nyou hear, on the ground of prejudice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt least you'll get his own impressions this time, if it's true that\\r\\nhe kept a diary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt depends on the diary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton amended. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I confess to some\\r\\nhopes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they drew near the door of Heatherfield, Dr. Ringwood's thoughts\\r\\nreverted to the state of things in the house. Glancing up at the\\r\\nfront, his eye was caught by a lighted window which had been dark on\\r\\nhis previous visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat looks like a bedroom up there with the light on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out\\r\\nto his companion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn't lit up last time I was here. Perhaps\\r\\nSilverdale or his wife has come home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA shapeless shadow swept momentarily across the curtains of the\\r\\nlighted room as they watched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a relief to my mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't quite\\r\\nlike leaving that maid alone with my patient. One never can tell what\\r\\nmay happen in a fever case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were ascending the steps, a further thought struck him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want to be advertised here\\xe2\\x80\\x94your name, I mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think not, at present, so long as I can telephone without being\\r\\noverheard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. I'll fix it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood agreed, as he put his finger on\\r\\nthe bell-push.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to his surprise, his ring brought no one to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat woman must be deaf, surely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as he pressed the button a\\r\\nsecond time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe came quick enough the last time I was here. I hope\\r\\nnothing's gone wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton waited until the prolonged peal of the bell ended when the\\r\\ndoctor took his finger away, then he bent down to the slit of the\\r\\nletter-box and listened intently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could swear I heard someone moving about, just then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as\\r\\nhe rose to his full height again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere must be someone on the\\r\\npremises to account for the shadow we saw at the window. This looks a\\r\\nbit rum, doctor. Ring again, will you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood obeyed. They could hear the trilling of a heavy gong\\r\\nsomewhere in the back of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat ought to wake anyone up, surely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with a nervous tinge\\r\\nin his voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is my second experience of the sort this evening.\\r\\nI don't much care about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited for a minute, but no one came to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not strictly legal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said at last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we've got to\\r\\nget inside somehow. I think we'll make your patient an excuse, if the\\r\\nworst comes to the worst. Just wait here a moment and I'll see what\\r\\ncan be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went down the steps and disappeared in the fog. Dr. Ringwood waited\\r\\nfor a minute or two, and then steps sounded in the hall behind the\\r\\ndoor. Sir Clinton opened it and motioned him to come in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe place seems to be empty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said hurriedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStay here and see\\r\\nthat no one passes you. I want to go round the ground floor first of\\r\\nall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved from door to door in the hall, switching on the lights and\\r\\nswiftly inspecting each room as he came to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported, and then made his way into the kitchen\\r\\npremises.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood heard his steps retreating; then, after a short interval,\\r\\nthere came the sound of a door closing and the shooting of a bolt. It\\r\\nwas not long before Sir Clinton reappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody's been on the premises,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat must have\\r\\nbeen the sound I heard. The back door was open.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood felt himself at a loss amid the complexities of his\\r\\nadventures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope that confounded maid hasn't got the wind up and cleared out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe exclaimed, his responsibility for his patient coming foremost in\\r\\nthe confusion of the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo use thinking of chasing anyone through this fog,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nconfessed, betraying in his turn his own professional bias. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhoever\\r\\nit was has got clean away. Let's go upstairs and have a look round,\\r\\ndoctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading the way, he snapped down the switch at the foot of the\\r\\nstair-case; but to Dr. Ringwood's surprise, no light appeared above.\\r\\nSir Clinton pulled a flash-lamp from his pocket and hurried towards\\r\\nthe next flat; as he rounded the turn of the stair, he gave a muffled\\r\\nexclamation. At the same moment, a high-pitched voice higher up in the\\r\\nhouse broke into a torrent of aimless talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat girl's a bit delirious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood diagnosed, as he heard the\\r\\nsound; and he quickened his ascent. But as he reached a little landing\\r\\nand could see ahead of him, he was brought up sharply by the sight\\r\\nwhich met his eyes. Sir Clinton was bending with his flash-lamp over a\\r\\nhuddled mass which lay on the floor at the head of the flight, and a\\r\\nglance showed the doctor that it was the body of the maid who had\\r\\nadmitted him to the house on his earlier visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome here, doctor, and see if anything can be done for her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton's voice broke in on his surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaped up the intervening steps and stooped in his turn over the\\r\\nbody, while Sir Clinton made way for him and kept the flash-lamp\\r\\nplaying on the face. Down the well of the stairs came the voice of the\\r\\ndelirious patient, sunk now to a querulous drone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe briefest examination showed that the victim was beyond help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe might try artificial respiration, but it would really be simply\\r\\ntime lost. She's been strangled pretty efficiently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face had grown dark as he bent over the body, but his\\r\\nvoice betrayed nothing of his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you'd better go up and look after that girl upstairs, doctor.\\r\\nShe's evidently in a bad way. I'll attend to things here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood mechanically switched on the light of the next flight in\\r\\nthe stairs and then experienced a sort of subconscious surprise to\\r\\nfind it in action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought the fuse had gone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained involuntarily, as he\\r\\nhurried up the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft to himself, Sir Clinton turned his flash-lamp upwards on to the\\r\\nfunctionless electric light bracket above the landing and saw, as he\\r\\nhad expected, that the bulb had been removed from the socket. A very\\r\\nshort search revealed the lamp itself lying on the carpet. The Chief\\r\\nConstable picked it up gingerly and examined it minutely with his\\r\\npocket-light; but his scrutiny merely proved that the glass was\\r\\nunmarked by any recent finger-prints. He put it carefully aside,\\r\\nentered the lighted bedroom, and secured a fresh bulb from one of the\\r\\nlamp-sockets there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this he returned to the landing and glanced round in search of\\r\\nsomething on which to stand, so that he could put the new bulb in the\\r\\nempty socket. The only available piece of furniture was a small table\\r\\nuntidily covered with a cloth, which stood in one corner of the\\r\\nlanding. Sir Clinton stepped across to it and inspected it minutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody's been standing on that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he noted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the traces are just\\r\\nabout nil. The cloth's thick enough to have saved the table-top from\\r\\nany marks of his boot-nails.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the table untouched, he re-entered the room he had already\\r\\nvisited and secured another small table, by means of which he was able\\r\\nto climb up and fix the new bulb in the empty socket over the landing.\\r\\nIt refused to light, however, and he had to go to the foot of the\\r\\nstairs and reverse the switch before the current came on.\\r\\n\\r\\nShutting off his flash-lamp, Sir Clinton returned to the landing and\\r\\nbent once more over the body. The cause of death was perfectly\\r\\napparent: a cord with a rough wooden handle at each end had been\\r\\nslipped round the woman's throat and had been used as a tourniquet on\\r\\nher neck. The deep biting of the cord into the flesh indicated with\\r\\nsufficient plainness the brutality of the killer. Sir Clinton did not\\r\\nprolong his examination, and when he had finished, he drew out his\\r\\npocket-handkerchief and covered the distorted face of the body. As he\\r\\ndid so, Dr. Ringwood descended the stairs behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll need to telephone for the hospital van,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's out of\\r\\nthe question to leave that girl here in the state she's in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded his agreement. Then a thought seemed to strike him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite off her rocker, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr did she understand\\r\\nyou when you spoke to her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDelirious. She didn't even seem to recognise me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood\\r\\nexplained shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the reason for the Chief Constable's questions seemed to occur to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean she might be able to give evidence? It's out of the\\r\\nquestion. She's got a very bad attack. She won't remember anything,\\r\\neven if she's seen something or heard sounds. You'd get nothing out of\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton showed no particular disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hardly expected much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood continued his way down stairs and made his way to the\\r\\ntelephone. When he had sent his message, he walked up again to the\\r\\nfirst floor. A light was on in one of the rooms, and he pushed open\\r\\nthe door and entered, to find Sir Clinton kneeling on the floor in\\r\\nfront of an antique chest of drawers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA glance round the room showed the doctor that it belonged to Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale. Through the half-open door of a wardrobe he caught sight\\r\\nof some dresses; the dressing-table was littered with feminine\\r\\nknick-knacks, among which was a powder-puff which the owner had not\\r\\nreplaced in its box; a dressing-jacket hung on a chair close to the\\r\\nsingle bed. The whole room betrayed its constant use by some woman who\\r\\nwas prepared to spend time on her toilette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFound anything further?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood inquired as Sir Clinton glanced\\r\\nup from his task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing except this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable indicated the lowest drawer in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody's broken the lock and gone inside in a hurry. The drawer's\\r\\nbeen shoved home anyhow and left projecting a bit. It caught my eye\\r\\nwhen I came in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled the drawer open as he spoke, and Dr. Ringwood moved across\\r\\nand looked down into it over the Chief Constable's shoulder. A number\\r\\nof jewel-boxes lay in one corner, and Sir Clinton turned his attention\\r\\nto these in the first place. He opened them, one after another, and\\r\\nfound the contents of most of them in place. One or two rings, and a\\r\\ncouple of small articles seemed to be missing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite likely these are things she's wearing to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained,\\r\\nreplacing the leather cases in the drawer as he spoke. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll try\\r\\nagain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing which came to his hand was a packet of photographs of\\r\\nvarious people. Among them was one of young Hassendean, but it seemed\\r\\nto have no special value for Mrs. Silverdale, since it had been\\r\\ncarelessly thrust in among the rest of the packet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing particularly helpful there, it seems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Sir Clinton's\\r\\nopinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned next to several old dance-programmes which had been\\r\\npreserved with some care. Lifting them in turn and holding them so\\r\\nthat the doctor could see them, the Chief Constable glanced at the\\r\\nscribbled names of the various partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne gentleman seems to have been modest, anyhow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\r\\ninitials, even\\xe2\\x80\\x94just an asterisk on the line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flipped the programmes over rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Asterisk seems to be a favourite, doctor. He occurs pretty often\\r\\nat each dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer dancing-partner, probably,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood surmised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYoung\\r\\nHassendean, most likely, I should think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton put down the programmes and searched again in the drawer.\\r\\nHis hand fell on a battered notebook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPart of a diary she seems to have kept while she was in a\\r\\nconvent. . . . H'm! Just a school-girl's production,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he turned over a\\r\\nfew pages, reading as he went, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand not altogether a nice\\r\\nschool-girl,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he concluded, after he had paused at one entry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's\\r\\nnothing to be got out of that just now. I suppose it may be useful\\r\\nlater on, in certain circumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid the little book down again and turned once more to the drawer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat seems to be the lot. One thing's pretty clear. The person who\\r\\nbroke that lock wasn't a common burglar, for he'd have pouched the\\r\\ntrinkets. The bother is that we ought to find out what this search was\\r\\nfor; and since the thing has probably been removed, it leaves one with\\r\\na fairly wide field for guessing. Let's have another look round.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he bent forward and picked up a tiny object from the bottom\\r\\nof the drawer. As he lifted it, Dr. Ringwood could see that it was a\\r\\nscrap of paper; and when it was turned over he recognised it as a\\r\\nfragment torn from the corner of an envelope with part of the stamp\\r\\nstill adhering to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! Suggestive rather than conclusive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Sir Clinton's verdict.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy first guess would be that this has been torn off a roughly-opened\\r\\nletter. So there must have been letters in this drawer at one time or\\r\\nanother. But whether our murderous friend was after a packet of\\r\\nletters or not, one can't say definitely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood up and moved under the electric light in order to examine the\\r\\nfragment closely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's got the local post-mark on it. I can see the VEN. The date's\\r\\n1925, but the month part has been torn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe showed the scrap to Dr. Ringwood and then placed it carefully in\\r\\nhis note-case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hate jumping to conclusions, doctor; but it certainly does look as\\r\\nif someone had broken in here to get hold of letters. And they must\\r\\nhave been pretty important letters if it was worth while to go the\\r\\nlength of casual murder to secure them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must have been a pretty hard case to murder a defenceless woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face showed a faint trace of a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are _two_ sexes, doctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? . . . Oh, of course. I said \\xe2\\x80\\x98_he_ must,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and you\\r\\nthink it might have been a woman?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't think so; but I hate to prejudge the case, you know. All that\\r\\none can really say is that _someone_ came here and killed that\\r\\nunfortunate woman. The rest's simply conjecture and may be right or\\r\\nwrong. It's easy enough to make up a story to fit the facts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood walked across to the nearest chair and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy brain's too fagged to produce anything of the sort, I'm afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I'd like to hear anything that would explain the\\r\\ndamned business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton closed the drawer gently and turned round to face the\\r\\ndoctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, it's easy enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether it's the true solution or\\r\\nnot's quite another question. You came here about twenty past ten,\\r\\nwere let in by the maid, saw your patient, listened to what the maid\\r\\nhad to tell you\\xe2\\x80\\x94lucky for us you took that precaution or we'd have\\r\\nmissed all that evidence, since she can't tell us now\\xe2\\x80\\x94and left this\\r\\nhouse at twenty-five to eleven. We came back again, just an hour\\r\\nlater. The business was done in between those times, obviously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot much theory there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm simply trying it over in my mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nit's just as well to have the time-limits clear to start with. Now we\\r\\ngo on. Some time after you had got clear away from here, the murderer\\r\\ncomes along. Let's call that person X, just to avoid all prejudice\\r\\nabout age or sex. Now X has thought out this murder beforehand, but\\r\\nnot very long beforehand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you make that out?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause the two bits of wood which form the handles of the tourniquet\\r\\nare simply pieces cut off a tree, and freshly cut, by the look of the\\r\\nends. X must have had possession of these before coming into the\\r\\nhouse\\xe2\\x80\\x94hence premeditation. But if it had been a case of long\\r\\npremeditation, X would have had something better in the way of\\r\\nhandles. I certainly wouldn't have risked landing on a convenient\\r\\nbranch at the last moment if I'd been doing the job myself; and X, I\\r\\nmay say, strikes me as a remarkably cool, competent person, as you'll\\r\\nsee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor said, making no attempt to conceal his interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur friend X probably had the cord in his or her pocket and had\\r\\nconstructed the rough tourniquet while coming along the road. Our\\r\\nfriend X was wearing gloves, I may say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ringwood asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll see later. Now X went up to the front door and rang the bell.\\r\\nThe maid came along, recognised X. . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ringwood repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't know it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just giving you the hypothesis you asked for. I\\r\\ndon't say it's correct. To continue: this person X inquired if\\r\\nSilverdale (or Mrs. Silverdale, perhaps) was at home. Naturally the\\r\\nmaid said no. Most likely she told X that her companion had\\r\\nscarlatina. Then X decided to leave a note, and was invited into the\\r\\nhouse to write it. It was a long note, apparently; and the maid was\\r\\ntold to go to the kitchen and wait till X had finished. So off she\\r\\nwent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cX had no intention of putting pen to paper, of course. As soon as the\\r\\nmaid was out of the way, X slipped upstairs and switched on the light\\r\\nin this room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd forgotten it was the light in this window that we saw from the\\r\\noutside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, very quietly, by shifting the table on the landing under the\\r\\nelectric light, X removed the bulb that lighted the stair. One can\\r\\nreach it by standing on that table. Then X shifted the table back to\\r\\nits place. There were no finger-prints on the bulb\\xe2\\x80\\x94ergo, X must have\\r\\nbeen wearing gloves, as I told you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to have got a lot of details,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why\\r\\nall this man\\xc5\\x93uvring?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll see immediately. I think I said already that whoever did the\\r\\nbusiness was a very cool and competent person. When all was ready, X\\r\\nattracted the maid's attention in some way. She came to the foot of\\r\\nthe stairs, suspecting nothing, but probably wondering what X was\\r\\ndoing, wandering about the house. It's quite likely that X made the\\r\\nsick girl upstairs the pretext for calling and wandering out of\\r\\nbounds. Anyhow, the maid came to the foot of the stairs and moved the\\r\\nswitch of the landing light. Nothing happened, of course, since the\\r\\nbulb had been removed. She tried the switch backwards and forwards\\r\\nonce or twice most likely, and then she would conclude that the lamp\\r\\nwas broken or the fuse gone. Probably she saw the reflection of the\\r\\nlight from the room-door. In any case, she came quite unsuspiciously\\r\\nup the stair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton paused, as though to allow the doctor to raise objections;\\r\\nbut none came, so he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeanwhile X had taken up a position opposite the door of the room, at\\r\\nthe foot of the second flight of stairs. If you remember, a person\\r\\ncrouching there in semi-darkness would be concealed from anyone\\r\\nmounting the first flight. The tourniquet was ready, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood shuddered slightly. Apparently he found Sir Clinton's\\r\\npicture a vivid one, in spite of the casual tone in which it had been\\r\\ndrawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe girl came up, quite unsuspicious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\r\\nknew X; it wasn't a question of a street-loafer or anything of that\\r\\nsort. An attack would be the last thing to cross her mind. And then,\\r\\nin an instant, the attack fell. Probably she turned to go into the\\r\\nlighted room, thinking that X was there; and then the noose would be\\r\\nround her neck, a knee would be in her back and . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a grim movement, Sir Clinton completed his narrative of the\\r\\nmurder more effectively than words could have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat left X a clear field. The girl upstairs was light-headed and\\r\\ncouldn't serve as a witness. X daren't go near her for fear of\\r\\ncatching scarlatina\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that would have been a fatal business, for\\r\\nnaturally we shall keep our eye on all fresh scarlet cases for the\\r\\nnext week or so. It's on the cards that her scarlatina has saved her\\r\\nlife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood's face showed his appreciation of this point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pressed Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe rest's obvious. X came in here, hunting for something which we\\r\\nhaven't identified. Whatever it was, it was in this drawer and X knew\\r\\nwhere it was. Nothing else has been disturbed except slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x94possibly\\r\\nin a hunt for the key of the drawer in case it had been left lying\\r\\naround loose. Not finding the key, X broke open the drawer and then we\\r\\nevidently arrived. That must have been a nasty moment up here. I don't\\r\\nenvy friend X's sensations when we rang the front door bell. But a\\r\\ncool head pulls one through difficulties of that sort. While we were\\r\\nstanding unsuspiciously on the front door steps, X slipped down\\r\\nstairs, out of the back door, and into the safety of the fog-screen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable rose to his feet as he concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen that's what happened, you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Doctor Ringwood asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's what _may_ have happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton replied cautiously.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome parts of it certainly are correct, since there's sound evidence\\r\\nto support them. The rest's no more than guess-work. Now I must go to\\r\\nthe 'phone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Chief Constable left the room, the sick girl upstairs whimpered\\r\\nfaintly, and Dr. Ringwood got out of his chair with a yawn which he\\r\\ncould not suppress. He paused on the threshold and looked out across\\r\\nthe body to the spot at the turn of the stair. Sir Clinton's\\r\\nword-picture of the murderer crouching there in ambush with his\\r\\ntourniquet had been a little too vivid for the doctor's imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter V\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bungalow Tragedy\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of his career, Sir Clinton Driffield had found it\\r\\nimportant to devote some attention to his outward appearance; but his\\r\\nobject in doing so had been different from that of most men, for he\\r\\naimed at making himself as inconspicuous as possible. To look\\r\\nwell-dressed, but not too smart; to seem intelligent without betraying\\r\\nhis special acuteness; to be able to meet people without arousing any\\r\\nspeculations about himself in their minds; above all, to eliminate the\\r\\nslightest suggestion of officialism from his manner: these had been\\r\\nthe objects of no little study on his part. In the days when he had\\r\\nheld junior posts, this protective mimicry of the average man had\\r\\nserved his purposes excellently, and he still cultivated it even\\r\\nthough its main purpose had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated at his office desk, with its wire baskets holding packets of\\r\\nneatly-docketed papers, he would have passed as a junior director in\\r\\nsome big business firm. Only a certain tiredness about his eyes hinted\\r\\nat the sleepless night he had spent at Heatherfield and Ivy Lodge, and\\r\\nwhen he began to open his letters, even this symptom seemed to fade\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he picked up the envelopes before him, his eye was caught by the\\r\\nbrown cover of a telegram, and he opened it first. He glanced over the\\r\\nwording and his eyebrows lifted slightly. Then, putting down the\\r\\ndocument, he picked up his desk-telephone and spoke to one of his\\r\\nsubordinates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas Inspector Flamborough come in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. He's here just now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend him along to me, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReplacing the telephone on its bracket, Sir Clinton picked up the\\r\\ntelegram once more and seemed to reconsider its wording. He looked up\\r\\nas someone knocked on the door and entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorning, Inspector. You're looking a bit tired. I suppose you've\\r\\nfixed up all last night's business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Both bodies are in the mortuary; the doctor's been warned\\r\\nabout the P.M.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s; the coroner's been informed about the inquests. And\\r\\nI've got young Hassendean's papers all collected. I haven't had time\\r\\nto do more than glance through them yet, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton gave a nod of approval and flipped the telegram across his\\r\\ndesk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down and have a look at that, Inspector. You can add it to your\\r\\ncollection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough secured the slip of paper and glanced over it as he pulled\\r\\na chair towards the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98_Chief Constable, Westerhaven. Try hassendean bungalow lizardbridge\\r\\nroad justice._\\xe2\\x80\\x99 H'm! Handed in at the G.P.O. at 8.5 a.m. this morning.\\r\\nSeems to err a bit on the side of conciseness. He could have had three\\r\\nmore words for his bob, and they wouldn't have come amiss. Who sent\\r\\nit, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA member of the Order of the Helpful Hand, perhaps. I found it on my\\r\\ndesk when I came in a few minutes ago. Now you know as much about it\\r\\nas I do, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of these amateur sleuths, you think, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the Inspector,\\r\\nand the sub-acid tinge in his tone betrayed his opinion of uninvited\\r\\nassistants. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had about my fill of that lot when we were handling\\r\\nthat Laxfield affair last year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused for a moment, and then continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's been pretty sharp with his help. It's handed in at 8.5 a.m. and\\r\\nthe only thing published about the affair is a stop-press note shoved\\r\\ninto the _Herald_. I bought a copy as I came along the road. Candidly,\\r\\nsir, it looks to me like a leg-pull.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced over the telegram disparagingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does he mean by \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lizardbridge road justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99? There's no J.P.\\r\\nliving on the Lizardbridge Road; and even if there were, the thing\\r\\ndoesn't make sense to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think \\xe2\\x80\\x98justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is the signature, Inspector\\xe2\\x80\\x94what one might term his\\r\\n_nom-de-kid_, if one leaned towards slang, which of course you never\\r\\ndo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector grinned. His unofficial language differed considerably\\r\\nfrom his official vocabulary, and Sir Clinton knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice? I like that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough ejaculated contemptuously, as he\\r\\nput the telegram down on the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks rather as though he wanted somebody's blood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nanswered carelessly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut all the same, Inspector, we can't afford to\\r\\nput it into the waste-paper basket. We're very short of anything you\\r\\ncould call a real clue in both these cases last night, remember. It\\r\\nwon't do to neglect this, even if it does turn out to be a mare's\\r\\nnest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough shrugged his shoulders almost imperceptibly, as\\r\\nthough to indicate that the decision was none of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll send a man down to the G.P.O. to make inquiries at once, sir, if\\r\\nyou think it necessary. At that time in the morning there can't have\\r\\nbeen many wires handed in and we ought to be able to get some\\r\\ndescription of the sender.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPossibly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was as far as Sir Clinton seemed inclined to go. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend off\\r\\nyour man, Inspector. And while he's away, please find out something\\r\\nabout this Hassendean Bungalow, as our friend calls it. It's bound to\\r\\nbe known to the Post Office people, and you'd better get on the local\\r\\nP.O. which sends out letters to it. The man who delivers the post\\r\\nthere will be able to tell you something about it. Get the 'phone to\\r\\nwork at once. If it's a hoax, we may as well know that at the earliest\\r\\nmoment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector, recognising that it was useless\\r\\nto convert Sir Clinton to his own view.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the telegram, put it in his pocket, and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Inspector had gone, Sir Clinton ran rapidly through his\\r\\nletters, and then turned to the documents in the wire baskets. He had\\r\\nthe knack of working his mind by compartments when he chose, and it\\r\\nwas not until Flamborough returned with his report that the Chief\\r\\nConstable gave any further thought to the Hassendean case. He knew\\r\\nthat the Inspector could be trusted to get the last tittle of useful\\r\\ninformation when he had been ordered to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Hassendeans _have_ a bungalow on the Lizardbridge Road, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nFlamborough confessed when he came back once more. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got the local\\r\\npostman to the 'phone and he gave me as much as one could expect. Old\\r\\nHassendean built the thing as a spec., hoping to get a good price for\\r\\nit. Ran it up just after the war. But it cost too much, and he's been\\r\\nleft with it on his hands. It's just off the road, on the hill about\\r\\nhalf-way between here and the new place they've been building lately,\\r\\nthat farm affair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I know the place. I've\\r\\ndriven past it often: a brown-tiled roof and a lot of wood on the\\r\\nfront of the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's it, sir. The postman described it to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything more about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's empty most of the year, sir. The Hassendeans use it as a kind of\\r\\nsummer place\\xe2\\x80\\x94shift up there in the late spring, usually, the postman\\r\\nsaid. It overlooks the sea and stands high, you remember. Plenty of\\r\\nfresh air. But it's shut up just now, sir. They came back to town over\\r\\ntwo months ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94middle of September or thereabouts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed to wake up suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat fails to stir you, Inspector? Strange! Now it interests me\\r\\ndevilishly, I can assure you. We'll run up there now in my car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector was obviously disconcerted by this sudden desire for\\r\\ntravel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's hardly worth your while to go all that way, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he protested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can easily go out myself if you think it necessary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton signed a couple of documents before replying. Then he rose\\r\\nfrom his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't mind saying, Inspector, that two murders within three hours\\r\\nis too high an average for my taste when they happen in my district.\\r\\nIt's a case of all hands to the pumps, now, until we manage to get on\\r\\nthe track. I'm not taking the thing out of your hands. It's simply\\r\\ngoing on the basis that two heads are better than one. We've got to\\r\\nget to the bottom of the business as quick as we can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI quite understand, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough acknowledged without pique.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no grudge in the matter. I'm only afraid that this business\\r\\nis a practical joke and you'll be wasting your time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton dissented from the last statement with a movement of his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe ought to take a doctor with us. If there's\\r\\nanything in the thing at all, I've a feeling that Mr. Justice hasn't\\r\\ndisturbed us for a trifle. Let's see. Dr. Steel will have his hands\\r\\nfull with things just now; we'll need to get someone else. That\\r\\nRingwood man has his wits about him, from what I saw of him. Ring him\\r\\nup, Inspector, and ask him if he can spare the time. Tell him what\\r\\nit's about, and if he's the sportsman I take him for, he'll come if he\\r\\ncan manage it. Tell him we'll call for him in ten minutes and bring\\r\\nhim home again as quick as we can. And get them to bring my car round\\r\\nnow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty minutes later, as they passed up an avenue, Sir Clinton turned\\r\\nto Dr. Ringwood:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecognise it, doctor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever seen it before to my knowledge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were here last night, though. Look, there's Ivy Lodge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I see by the name on the gate-post. But remember it's the first\\r\\ntime I've seen the house itself. The fog hid everything last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton swung the car to the left at the end of the avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shan't be long now. It's a straight road out from here to the\\r\\nplace we're bound for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they reached the outskirts of Westerhaven, Sir Clinton increased\\r\\nhis speed, and in a very short time Dr. Ringwood found himself\\r\\napproaching a long low bungalow which faced the sea-view at a little\\r\\ndistance from the road. It had been built in the shelter of a\\r\\nplantation, the trees of which dominated it on one side; and the\\r\\ngarden was dotted with clumps of quick-growing shrubs which helped to\\r\\ngive it the appearance of maturity.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough stepped down from the back seat of the car as\\r\\nSir Clinton drew up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe gate's not locked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported, as he went up to it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust wait\\r\\na moment, sir, while I have a look at the surface of the drive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked a short distance towards the house, with his eyes on the\\r\\nground; then he returned and swung the leaves of the gate open for the\\r\\ncar to pass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can drive in, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ground was hard last night,\\r\\nyou remember; and there isn't a sign of anything in the way of\\r\\nfootmarks or wheel-prints to be seen there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the car passed him, he swung himself aboard again; and Sir Clinton\\r\\ndrove up to near the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll get down here, I think, and walk the rest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he proposed,\\r\\nswitching off his engine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see. Curtains all drawn. . . . Hullo!\\r\\nOne of the small panes of glass on that front window has been smashed,\\r\\njust at the lever catch. You owe an apology to Mr. Justice, Inspector,\\r\\nI think. He's not brought us here to an absolute mare's nest, at any\\r\\nrate. There's been housebreaking going on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowed by the others, he walked over to the damaged window and\\r\\nexamined it carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo foot-prints or anything of that sort to be seen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out,\\r\\nglancing at the window-sill. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe window's been shut, apparently,\\r\\nafter the housebreaker got in\\xe2\\x80\\x94if he did get in at all. That would be\\r\\nan obvious precaution, in case the open window caught someone's eye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe transferred his attention to the casement itself. It was a\\r\\nsteel-framed one, some four feet high by twenty inches wide, which\\r\\nformed part of a set of three which together made up the complete\\r\\nwindow. Steel bars divided it into eight small panes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Burglar's Delight!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton described it scornfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nknock in one pane, just like this; then you put your hand through;\\r\\nturn the lever-fastener; swing the casement back on its hinges\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nwalk inside. There isn't even the trouble of hoisting a sash as you\\r\\nhave to do with the old-fashioned window. Two seconds would see you\\r\\ninside the house, with only this affair to tackle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced doubtfully at the lever handle behind the broken glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere might be finger-prints on that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't want to\\r\\ntouch it. Just go round to the front door, Inspector, and see if it's\\r\\nopen by any chance. If not, we'll smash the glass at the other end of\\r\\nthis window and use the second casement to get in by, so as not to\\r\\nconfuse things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Inspector had reported the front door locked, the Chief\\r\\nConstable carried out his proposal; the untouched casement swung open,\\r\\nand they prepared to enter the room, which hitherto had been concealed\\r\\nfrom them by the drawn curtains. Sir Clinton led the way, and as he\\r\\npushed the curtain out of his road, his companions heard a bitten-off\\r\\nexclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot much of a mare's nest, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued in a cooler tone.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet inside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector, followed by Dr. Ringwood, climbed through the open\\r\\ncasement and stared in astonishment at the sight before them. The\\r\\nplace they had entered was evidently one of the sitting-rooms of the\\r\\nbungalow, and the dust-sheets which covered the furniture indicated\\r\\nthat the building had been shut up for the winter. In a big arm-chair,\\r\\nfacing them as they entered, sat the body of a girl in evening dress\\r\\nwith a cloak around her shoulders. A slight trail of blood had oozed\\r\\nfrom a wound in her head and marked her shoulder on the right side. On\\r\\nthe floor at her feet lay an automatic pistol. One or two small chairs\\r\\nseemed to have been displaced roughly in the room, as though some\\r\\nstruggle had taken place; but the attitude of the girl in the chair\\r\\nwas perfectly natural. It seemed as though she had sat down merely to\\r\\nrest and death had come upon her without any warning, for her face had\\r\\nno tinge of fear in its expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn't far out in putting my money on Mr. Justice, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton said thoughtfully, as he gazed at the dead girl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might\\r\\nhave been days before we came across this affair without his help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced round the room for a moment, biting his lip as though\\r\\nperplexed by some problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'd better have a general look round before touching the details,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe suggested, at last; and he led the way out of the room into the\\r\\nhall of the bungalow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll try the rooms as we come to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuiting the action to the word, he opened the first door that came to\\r\\nhand. It proved to be that of a dismantled bedroom. The dressing-table\\r\\nwas bare and everything had been removed from the bed expect a wire\\r\\nmattress. The second door led into what was obviously the dining-room\\r\\nof the bungalow; and here again the appearance of the room showed that\\r\\nthe house had been shut up for the season. A third trial revealed a\\r\\nlavatory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! Clean towels hanging on the rail?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pointed out.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's unusual in an empty house, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for a minuter examination, he turned to the next door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome sort of store-room, apparently. These mattresses belong to the\\r\\nbeds, obviously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong one side of the little room were curtained shelves. Sir Clinton\\r\\nslid back the curtains and revealed the stacked house-napery, towels,\\r\\nand sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody seems to have been helping themselves here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he indicated,\\r\\ndrawing his companions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attention to one or two places where the\\r\\norderly piling of the materials had been disturbed by careless\\r\\nwithdrawals. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll try again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next room provided a complete contrast to the rest of the house.\\r\\nIt was a bedroom with all its fittings in place. The bed, fully made\\r\\nup, had obviously not been slept in. The dressing-table was covered\\r\\nwith the usual trifles which a girl uses in her toilette. Vases, which\\r\\nobviously did not belong to the normal equipment of the room, had been\\r\\ncollected here and filled with a profusion of expensive flowers. Most\\r\\nsurprising of all, an electric stove, turned on at half power, kept\\r\\nthe room warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's been living here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector exclaimed in a tone which\\r\\nrevealed his astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton made a gesture of dissent. He crossed the room, and threw\\r\\nopen the door of a cupboard wardrobe, revealing empty hooks and\\r\\nshelves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe'd hardly be living here with nothing but an evening frock in the\\r\\nway of clothes, would she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can look round if you like,\\r\\nInspector; but I'm prepared to bet that she never set foot in this\\r\\nroom. You won't find much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped over to the dressing-table and examined one by one the\\r\\nknick-knacks placed upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese things are all split-new, Inspector. Look at this face-powder\\r\\nbox\\xe2\\x80\\x94not been opened, the band's still intact on it. And the\\r\\nlip-stick's unused. You can see that at a glance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough had to admit the truth of his superior's statements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reflected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course it's Mrs. Silverdale, I suppose, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should think so, but we can make sure about it very soon. In the\\r\\nmeantime, let's finish going round the premises.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the survey revealed very little. The remainder of the\\r\\nhouse was obviously dismantled for the winter. Only once did Sir\\r\\nClinton halt for any time, and that was in the pantry. Here he\\r\\nexamined the cups suspended from hooks on the wall and pointed out to\\r\\nFlamborough the faint film of accumulated dust on each of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone of that crockery has been used for weeks, Inspector. One can't\\r\\nlive in a house without eating and drinking, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA port of call, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector persisted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe and young\\r\\nHassendean could drop in here without rousing any suspicion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton conceded abstractedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we'll get Dr.\\r\\nRingwood to give his assistance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led the way back to the room through which they had entered the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was dead before that shot was fired, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said as they\\r\\ncrossed the threshold. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut beyond that there ought to be something to\\r\\nbe seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat makes you so sure that the shot didn't kill her, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\nInspector demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause there wasn't half enough blood scattered about the place. She\\r\\nwas dead when the shot was fired\\xe2\\x80\\x94must have been dead for some minutes,\\r\\nI suspect. There was no heart-action to lift the blood in her body, so\\r\\nconsequently it sank under gravity and left her skull nearly empty of\\r\\nit. Then when the shot was fired, only the merest trickle came from\\r\\nthe wound. I think that's right, isn't it, doctor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's quite on the cards,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Ringwood agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly there\\r\\nwasn't the normal amount of bleeding that one might have expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen the really important point is: how did she come to die. This is\\r\\nwhere we rely on you, doctor. Go ahead, please, and see what you make\\r\\nof it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood went over to the arm-chair and began his examination of\\r\\nthe dead girl. His glance travelled first to the open eyes, which\\r\\nseemed curiously dark; and a very brief inspection of their abnormal\\r\\nappearance suggested one possible verdict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks as if she'd had a dose of one of these mydriatic\\r\\ndrugs\\xe2\\x80\\x94atropine, or something of that sort. The eye-pupils are markedly\\r\\ndilated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pronounced.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton refrained from glancing at the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you couldn't make a guess at the time of death?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ninquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood tested the stiffness of the limbs, but from his face they\\r\\ngathered that it was almost a purely formal experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not going to bluff about the thing. You know yourselves that\\r\\n_rigor mortis_ is only the roughest test; and when there's an unknown\\r\\npoison to complicate matters, I simply couldn't give you a figure that\\r\\nwould be worth the breath spent on it. She's been dead for some\\r\\nhours\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you could have guessed that for yourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongratulations, doctor! There are so few people in this world who\\r\\nhave the honesty to say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don't know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when they're questioned on\\r\\ntheir own speciality. Now you might have a look at the wound, if you\\r\\ndon't mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dr. Ringwood was carrying out this part of his examination,\\r\\nInspector Flamborough occupied himself in a search of the room. An\\r\\nejaculation from him brought Sir Clinton to his side, and the\\r\\nInspector pointed to a dark patch on the floor which had hitherto been\\r\\nconcealed by one of the displaced chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's quite a big pool of blood here, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said tilting the\\r\\nchair so that the Chief Constable could see it better. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you\\r\\nmake of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton looked at him quizzically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink you've caught me tripping, Inspector? Not in this, I'm afraid.\\r\\nThat's not the girl's blood at all. Unless I'm far out, it's young\\r\\nHassendean's. Now, while you're about it, will you have a good look\\r\\nfor empty cartridge-cases on the floor. There ought to be three of\\r\\nthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector set to work, industriously grovelling on the floor as he\\r\\nsearched under the heavier articles of furniture in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, doctor, what do you make of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton asked, when he saw\\r\\nthat Ringwood had completed his examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's plain enough on the surface,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor answered, as he turned\\r\\naway from the body. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must have been shot at quite close quarters,\\r\\njust above the ear. Her hair is singed with the flame of the powder.\\r\\nThe bullet went clean through the head and then into the padded\\r\\near-piece of the chair. I expect it's stuck there. You can see for\\r\\nyourself that the shot didn't produce any twitch in the body; the\\r\\nposition she's sitting in shows that well enough. I'm quite prepared\\r\\nto bet that she was dead before the shot was fired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe P.M. will clear that up for us definitely, if the poison can be\\r\\ndetected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut these vegetable poisons are\\r\\nsometimes the very devil to spot, if they're at all out-of-the-way\\r\\nones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned back to the Inspector, who was now on his feet again,\\r\\ndusting the knees of his trousers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've found three cartridge-cases sure enough, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reported. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo\\r\\nof them are under that couch over there; the third's in the corner\\r\\nnear the window. I didn't pick them up. We'll need to make a plan of\\r\\nthis room, I expect; and it's safest to leave things as they are, so\\r\\nas to be sure of the exact spots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton signified his approval.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the face of things, judging by the way an automatic ejects its\\r\\ncartridge, one might say that the single case near the window came\\r\\nfrom the shot that killed the girl. The other two, which landed\\r\\nsomewhere near each other, might represent the two shots that made the\\r\\nwounds in young Hassendean's lung. But that's mere speculation. Let's\\r\\nhave a look at the pistol, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, stooped down,\\r\\npicked up the pistol gingerly, and drew a rough outline of its\\r\\nposition on the floor with a piece of chalk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry it for finger-prints, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've got an insufflator\\r\\nin the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving permission, he hurried off to procure his powder-sprayer,\\r\\nand in a few minutes he had treated the pistol with the revealing\\r\\nmedium. As he did so, his face showed deepening disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing worth troubling about here, sir. Whoever it was handled this\\r\\npistol last must have been wearing gloves. There's nothing to be seen\\r\\nbut a few smears of no use to us at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed in no wise depressed by the news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen just open it up, Inspector, and have a look at the magazine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's three shots short of being full, sir, counting the cartridge\\r\\nthat must be in the barrel now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough explained, after he had\\r\\nslid the magazine from the butt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you've found all the empty cases corresponding to the number of\\r\\nshots fired from _this_ pistol, at any rate. We can leave someone else\\r\\nto hunt for extras when the plan's being made. I don't expect they'll\\r\\ndiscover any. Now we'll\\xe2\\x80\\x94H'm! What's this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped swiftly across the room and lifted something which had\\r\\nrolled under a little book-case standing on four feet. As he picked it\\r\\nup, his companions saw that it was an amber cigarette holder.\\r\\nFlamborough's face betrayed some mortification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could have sworn I looked under there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you did, Inspector; but it happened to be close up to one of the\\r\\nfeet of the bookcase, and probably it was hidden from you in the\\r\\nposition you were when you lay on the floor. It just happened to be in\\r\\nthe right line from where I was standing a moment ago. Now let's have\\r\\na look at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held it out, handling it by the tip with the greatest precaution to\\r\\navoid leaving his finger-prints upon the tube. At first sight, it\\r\\nseemed simply a cigarette-holder such as could be bought in any\\r\\ntobacconist's shop; but as he rotated it between his finger and thumb,\\r\\nthe other side of the barrel came into view and revealed a fly\\r\\nembedded in the material.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne hears a lot about flies in amber,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut this is\\r\\nthe first time I've seen one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood bent over and examined the imprisoned insect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat ought to be easy enough to identify,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never saw\\r\\na fly in amber before; and that one, with its wings half-spread, must\\r\\nbe fairly well known to most of the owner's friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may have nothing to do with the case, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Inspector\\r\\nFlamborough put in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's quite on the cards that it was dropped there\\r\\nat the time the house was open for the summer. Some visitor may have\\r\\nlost it, for all one can tell. Or it may belong to either of the\\r\\nHassendeans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton twisted the little object into a vertical position and\\r\\npeered into the cavity which had received the cigarettes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not a left-over from summer, Inspector. The tube's got quite a\\r\\nlot of tarry liquid in it. That would have gone viscid if the thing\\r\\nhad been lying there for a couple of months. No, it's been used quite\\r\\nrecently\\xe2\\x80\\x94within the last day or two, certainly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved towards the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust bring that machine of yours, Inspector, and blow some powder\\r\\nover it, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough obeyed; but the application of the powder revealed nothing\\r\\nexcept a few shapeless blotches on the stem of the holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ringwood exclaimed, with more than a tinge of\\r\\ndisappointment in his tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed the holder to Flamborough, who stowed it away safely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe've still to overhaul the body,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable suggested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'd better do that, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot much help in these modern dresses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Flamborough, eyeing the\\r\\ngirl's evening frock with a disparaging glance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she ought to have\\r\\na bag with her, surely. . . . Here it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe plunged his hand between the body and the chair and withdrew a\\r\\nlittle bag, which he proceeded to open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe usual powder-box,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began, enumerating the articles as they\\r\\ncame to hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall mirror, silver-mounted, no initials on it. Small\\r\\ncomb. Lipstick\\xe2\\x80\\x94been used once or twice. No money. No handkerchief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou found Mrs. Silverdale's handkerchief in the car last night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I suppose this must be her body, right enough, sir. Well, that\\r\\nseems to be all that's here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about these rings she's wearing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable suggested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee if you can get them off. There may be some inscriptions on the\\r\\ninside; some women go in for that kind of thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately the hands of the body were relaxed, and it was possible to\\r\\nremove the circlets from the fingers. Flamborough rose with three\\r\\nrings in his possession, which he examined with care.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're on the mark there, sir, right enough. Here's her wedding-ring.\\r\\nIt's engraved \\xe2\\x80\\x987\\xe2\\x80\\x9311\\xe2\\x80\\x9323\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94that'll be the date of her marriage, I\\r\\nsuppose. Then on each side of the date are initials. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Y.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94that's for\\r\\nYvonne Silverdale, obviously; and \\xe2\\x80\\x98F.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94these'll be her husband's\\r\\ninitials. Then there's a diamond ring that she was using for a keeper.\\r\\nLet's see. It's got the same pairs of initials on each side of the\\r\\ndate \\xe2\\x80\\x984\\xe2\\x80\\x9310\\xe2\\x80\\x9323.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That'll be her engagement-ring, I expect. H'm! They\\r\\ndon't seem to have given themselves much time for second thoughts if\\r\\nthe engagement lasted only a month and three days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed the two rings to Sir Clinton and picked the last one from\\r\\nhis palm for examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is off the little finger. It's a plain gold signet with Y and S\\r\\nintertwined on it. Evidently it's Mrs. Silverdale right enough, sir.\\r\\nThe inscription's inside . . . H'm! there's a variation here. The\\r\\ndate's \\xe2\\x80\\x9815\\xe2\\x80\\x9311\\xe2\\x80\\x9325\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here; but there's only a single letter at each end:\\r\\na Y at one side and a B at the other. That's a bit of a puzzle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nconcluded, glancing at his superior to see if he could detect anything\\r\\nin his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI agree with you, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all that he elicited for his pains.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow take off the bracelet, and that string of pearls round her neck.\\r\\nAnything of note on the bracelet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing whatever, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector reported after a glance at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, you'd better put these in a safe place when we get back to\\r\\ntown. Now does that finish us here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced round the room and his eye was caught by the second window\\r\\nwhich looked out from the side of the bungalow. The curtains were\\r\\nstill undrawn, and he noticed a minute gap through which the outer\\r\\ndaylight could pass freely. A thought seemed to strike him as he ran\\r\\nhis eyes over the fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll just go outside for a minute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced, and led the way\\r\\nthrough the hall and out of the front door. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see, that window's\\r\\nround here, isn't it. Keep back for a moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe halted outside the window and scrutinised the ground with care for\\r\\na few seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee that, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere aren't any foot-prints that\\r\\none could make anything out of; but someone has put his foot on the\\r\\nbox edging of the path just in front of the window. It's quite\\r\\nobviously crushed . . . and freshly crushed, too, by the look of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStepping softly on to the flower-bed which lay under the window-sill,\\r\\nhe bent down until his eye was level with the chink between the\\r\\ncurtains and peered through into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's interesting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as he turned again to face his\\r\\ncompanions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne gets quite a good view of the room from here; and it\\r\\nlooks as if somebody had taken advantage of it last night. Nobody\\r\\nwould attempt to look into a shut-up house in the dark, so presumably\\r\\nthe lights were on when he took the trouble to put his eye to the\\r\\ncrack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector made no pretence of concealing his delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we could only get hold of him. Perhaps he saw the murder actually\\r\\ndone, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed disinclined to rejoice too fervently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's all pure hypothesis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out, rather frigidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's rectitude forced him into a semi-apology for past\\r\\ndoubts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were quite right about Mr. Justice, sir. He's been a trump-card;\\r\\nand if we can only get hold of him and find out what he saw here last\\r\\nnight, the rest ought to be as easy as kiss-your-hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton could not restrain a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're devilish previous, Inspector, in spite of all I can do. This\\r\\nPeeping Tom may be Mr. Justice, or again he may not. There isn't any\\r\\nevidence either way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped back on to the path again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Inspector, we'll have to leave you here in charge. It seems to\\r\\nbe your usual r\\xc3\\xb4le in these days. I'll send a couple of men up to\\r\\nrelieve you\\xe2\\x80\\x94the fellow who makes our scale-models, too. You can set\\r\\nhim to work. And I'll make arrangements for the removal of Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's body.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. I'll stay here till relieved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen Dr. Ringwood and I had better get away at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked round the bungalow to the car. As he drove away, Sir\\r\\nClinton turned to the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must thank you again, doctor, for coming out here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, that's all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ringwood assured him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got Ryder to look\\r\\nafter my patients\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least the worst ones\\xe2\\x80\\x94this morning. Very decent of\\r\\nhim. He made no bones about it when he heard it was you who wanted me.\\r\\nIt hasn't been a pleasant job, certainly; but at least it's been a\\r\\nchange from the infernal grind of Carew's practice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton drove for a few minutes in silence, then he put a question\\r\\nto the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose it's not out of the question that young Hassendean might\\r\\nhave driven from the bungalow to Ivy Lodge with those wounds in his\\r\\nlungs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see nothing against it, unless the P.M. shows something that makes\\r\\nit impossible. People with lung-wounds\\xe2\\x80\\x94even fatal ones\\xe2\\x80\\x94have managed to\\r\\nget about quite spryly for a time. Of course, it's quite on the cards\\r\\nthat his moving about may have produced fresh lesions in the tissues.\\r\\nWhat surprises me more is how he managed to find his way home through\\r\\nthat fog last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat wouldn't be so difficult,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton rejoined. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis road runs\\r\\nright from the bungalow to the end of Lauderdale Avenue. He'd only to\\r\\nkeep his car straight and recognise the turn when he came to it. It\\r\\nwasn't a case of having to dodge through a network of streets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA thought seemed to occur to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, doctor, did you notice any peculiar coincidence in dates\\r\\nthat we've come across?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDates? No, can't say I did. What do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable pointed out deliberately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe date on\\r\\nthat scrap from the torn envelope we found in the drawer was 1925, and\\r\\nthe figures on that mysterious signet-ring were 5\\xe2\\x80\\x9311\\xe2\\x80\\x9325. It just\\r\\nhappened to strike me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner suggested that he had no desire to furnish any further\\r\\ninformation. Dr. Ringwood changed the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, you didn't examine the lever handle of the window for\\r\\nfinger-prints,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, with a note of interrogation in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Inspector will do that. He's very thorough. In any case, I don't\\r\\nexpect to find much on the lever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few moments Sir Clinton concentrated his attention on his\\r\\ndriving, as they were now within the outskirts of Westerhaven. When he\\r\\nspoke again, his remark struck the doctor as obscure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish that poor girl who was done in at Heatherfield last night\\r\\nhadn't been such a tidy creature.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ringwood stared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause if she'd shirked her job and left those coffee-cups unwashed,\\r\\nit might have saved us a lot of bother. But when I looked over the\\r\\nscullery, everything had been washed and put away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell . . . you don't seem to miss much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nsuppose it was what I repeated to you about Mrs. Silverdale looking\\r\\nqueer when she came out of the drawing-room\\xe2\\x80\\x94that put you on the track?\\r\\nYou were thinking of drugs, even then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered. Then, after a moment he added:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I've got a fair notion of what drug was used, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nine Possible Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police machinery under Sir Clinton's control always worked\\r\\nsmoothly, even when its routine was disturbed by such unpredictable\\r\\nevents as murders. Almost automatically, it seemed, that big, flexible\\r\\nengine had readjusted itself to the abnormal; the bodies of Hassendean\\r\\nand the maid at Heatherfield had been taken into its charge and all\\r\\narrangements had been made for dealing with them; Heatherfield itself\\r\\nhad been occupied by a constabulary picket; the photographic\\r\\ndepartment had been called in to take \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmetric photographs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d showing the\\r\\nexact positions of the bodies in the two houses; inquiries had\\r\\nramified through the whole district as to the motor-traffic during the\\r\\nprevious night; and a wide-flung intelligence system was unobtrusively\\r\\ncollecting every scrap of information which might have a bearing on\\r\\nthis suddenly presented problem. Finally, the organism had projected a\\r\\ntentacle to the relief of Inspector Flamborough, marooned at the\\r\\nbungalow, and had replaced him by a police picket while arrangements\\r\\nwere being made to remove Mrs. Silverdale's body and to map the\\r\\npremises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything fresh, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton demanded, glancing up from\\r\\nhis papers as his subordinate entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne or two more points cleared up, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough announced, with\\r\\na certain satisfaction showing on his good-humoured face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of\\r\\nall, I tried the lever of the window-hasp for finger-prints. There\\r\\nweren't any. So that's done with. I could see you didn't lay much\\r\\nstress on that part of the business, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable's nod gave acquiescence to this, and he waited for\\r\\nFlamborough to continue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've hunted for more blood-traces about the house; and I've found two\\r\\nor three small ones\\xe2\\x80\\x94a track leading from the room to the front door.\\r\\nThere was less blood than I expected, though.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe produced a blood-soaked handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was picked up near the corner of Lauderdale Avenue, sir, this\\r\\nmorning after the fog cleared away. It has an H in one corner. You\\r\\nremember we found no handkerchief on Hassendean's body. Evidently he\\r\\nwas using this one to staunch his wounds, and he probably let it drop\\r\\nout of the car at the place where it was found. The doctor said there\\r\\nmight be very little external bleeding, you remember; and the\\r\\nhandkerchief's mopped up a fair amount of what happened to ooze out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton again acquiesced, and the Inspector proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've taken the finger-prints from all three bodies, sir. They're\\r\\nfiled for reference, if need be. And I've had a good look at that\\r\\nside-window at the bungalow. There's no doubt that someone must have\\r\\nbeen standing there; but the traces are so poor that nothing can be\\r\\ndone in the way of a permanent record.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne can't even see the shape of the man's boot, let alone any fine\\r\\ndetails.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to have been fairly\\r\\nputting your back into it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face showed his appreciation of the compliment implied\\r\\nin the words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've drafted an advertisement\\xe2\\x80\\x94worded it very cautiously of\\r\\ncourse\\xe2\\x80\\x94asking Mr. Justice to favour us with some further information,\\r\\nif he has any in stock. That's been sent off already; it'll be in the\\r\\n_Evening Observer_ to-night, and in both the morning papers\\r\\nto-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood! Though I shouldn't get too optimistic over the results, if I\\r\\nwere you, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough assented to this. Putting his hand into his breast pocket\\r\\nhe produced a paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I've got a report from Detective-Sergeant Yarrow. I sent him\\r\\ndown to the G.P.O. to find out about Mr. Justice's telegram. It's\\r\\nimpossible to get a description of the sender, sir. The telegram\\r\\nwasn't handed in over the counter: it was dropped into a pillar box in\\r\\nthe suburbs in a plain envelope, along with the telegraph fee; and\\r\\nwhen it was taken to the G.P.O. they simply telegraphed it to our\\r\\nlocal office round the corner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Clinton. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere doesn't seem much likelihood of your\\r\\nadvertisement catching much, then. Mr. Justice is obviously a shy\\r\\nbird.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is indeed, sir, as you'll see in a moment. But I'll finish\\r\\nYarrow's report first, if you don't mind. When he heard this story at\\r\\nthe G.P.O., he asked for the postman who had brought in the envelope\\r\\nand questioned him. It appears the thing was dropped into the\\r\\npillar-box at the corner of Hill Street and Prince's Street. That's\\r\\nnowhere near the Lizardbridge Road, you remember\\xe2\\x80\\x94quite on the other\\r\\nside of the town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive miles at least from the bungalow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\r\\ngo on, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe postman made his collection, which included this envelope, at 7\\r\\na.m. this morning. The previous collection from the same box was made\\r\\nat 8 p.m. last night, Yarrow elicited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen all we really know is that the thing was dropped into the box\\r\\nbetween 8 p.m. and 7 a.m.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Yarrow secured the original telegram form,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\ncontinued with a glance at the paper in his hand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe envelope had\\r\\nbeen torn open carelessly and dropped into a waste-basket; but Yarrow\\r\\nsucceeded in getting hold of it also. There's no doubt about its\\r\\nidentity, sir. Yarrow ascertained through whose hands the envelope and\\r\\nthe enclosure had passed while they were in charge of the Post Office;\\r\\nand he persuaded all these people to let him have their finger-prints,\\r\\nwhich he took himself on the spot. He then brought all his material\\r\\nback here and had the envelope and its enclosure examined for\\r\\nfinger-prints; and the two documents were photographed after the\\r\\nprints had been brought up on them with a powder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they found nothing helpful, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing, so far, sir. Every print that came out belonged to the\\r\\npostman or the sorter, or the telegraphist. There wasn't one of them\\r\\nthat could belong to Mr. Justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you he was a shy bird, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector put his paper down on the desk before Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's all that, sir. He hasn't even given us a scrap of his\\r\\nhandwriting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable leaned forward and examined the document. It was\\r\\nan ordinary telegram despatch form, but the message: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Try hassendean\\r\\nbungalow lizardbridge road justice_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been constructed by gumming\\r\\nisolated letters and groups of letters on to the paper. No handwriting\\r\\nof any sort had been used.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton scanned the type for a moment, running his eye over the\\r\\nofficial printed directions on the form as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's simply cut his letters out of another telegram blank,\\r\\napparently?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather ingenious, that, since it leaves absolutely no chance of\\r\\nidentification. It's useless to begin inquiring where a telegraphic\\r\\nblank came from, even if one could identify the particular sheet that\\r\\nhe's been using. He's evidently got one of these rare minds than can\\r\\nsee the obvious and turn it to account. I'd like to meet Mr. Justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, it certainly doesn't leave much to take hold of, does it?\\r\\nYarrow's done his best; and I don't see how he could have done more.\\r\\nBut the result's just a blank end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton looked at his watch, took out his case and offered the\\r\\nInspector a cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down, Inspector. We're talking unofficially now, you'll note. I\\r\\nthink we might do worse than clear the decks in this business as far\\r\\nas possible before we go any further. It may save time in the end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough thought he saw a trap in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd like to hear what you think of it, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable's smile showed that he understood what was passing\\r\\nin Flamborough's mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd hate to ask a man to do something I didn't dare to do myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, with a faint twinkle in his eye. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I'll put my cards on the\\r\\ntable for you to look at. If the spirit moves you, Inspector, you can\\r\\ndo the same when your turn comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector's smile broadened into something like a grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. I understand that it's purely unofficial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the face of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo people got their deaths\\r\\nat the bungalow last night. Young Hassendean didn't actually die\\r\\nthere, of course, but the shooting took place there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough refrained from interrupting, but gave a nod of agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeaths by violence fall under three heads, I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief\\r\\nConstable pursued\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9caccident, suicide, and homicide, including murder.\\r\\nNow at the bungalow you had two people put to death, and in each case\\r\\nthe death must have been due to one or other of these three causes.\\r\\nEver do permutations and combinations at school, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough confessed, rather doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, taking the possible ways of two people dying one or other of\\r\\nthree different deaths, there are nine different arrangements. We'll\\r\\nwrite them down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a sheet of paper towards him, scribbled on it for a moment or\\r\\ntwo, and then slid it across the table towards the Inspector.\\r\\nFlamborough bent over and read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hassendean        Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\n  1.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Accident ..... Accident\\r\\n  2.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ...... Suicide\\r\\n  3.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ....... Murder\\r\\n  4.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Accident ..... Suicide\\r\\n  5.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ...... Accident\\r\\n  6.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Accident ..... Murder\\r\\n  7.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ....... Accident\\r\\n  8.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ...... Murder\\r\\n  9.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ....... Suicide\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, since in that table we've got every possible arrangement which\\r\\ntheoretically could occur,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe truth must lie\\r\\nsomewhere within the four corners of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, _somewhere_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Flamborough in an almost scornful tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we take each case in turn, we'll get a few notions about what\\r\\n_may_ have happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pursued, unmoved by the Inspector's\\r\\nobvious contempt for the idea. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut let's be clear on one or two\\r\\npoints to start with. The girl, so far as one can see at present, died\\r\\nfrom poison and was shot in the head after death. Young Hassendean\\r\\ndied from pistol-shots, of which there were two. Agreed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgreed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough conceded without enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen let's take the cases as we come to them. Case 1: The whole thing\\r\\nwas accidental. To fit that, the girl must have swallowed a fatal dose\\r\\nof poison, administered by mischance either by herself or by someone\\r\\nelse; and young Hassendean must either have shot himself twice by\\r\\naccident\\xe2\\x80\\x94which sounds unlikely\\xe2\\x80\\x94or else some third party\\r\\nunintentionally shot him twice over. What do you make of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn't sound very convincing, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake Case No. 2, then: A double suicide. What about that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese lovers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suicide-pacts aren't uncommon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector admitted.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat might be near the truth. And I suppose he might have put a\\r\\nbullet through her head before shooting himself, just in case the\\r\\npoison hadn't worked.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a notebook from his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust a moment, sir. I want to make a note to remind me to see about\\r\\nyoung Hassendean's pistol license, if he had one. I think he must have\\r\\nhad. I found a box and a half of ammunition in one of the drawers when\\r\\nI was searching the house after you'd gone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton paused while the Inspector made his jotting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we can take the third case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, as Flamborough closed\\r\\nhis pocket-book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt implies that Mrs. Silverdale was deliberately\\r\\npoisoned and that young Hassendean was shot to death intentionally,\\r\\neither by her before she died or by some third party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree of them seems more likely than two,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector suggested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's the man who opened the window to be fitted in somewhere, you\\r\\nknow, and there were signs of a struggle, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite true, Inspector. I suppose you can fit the shot in Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's head into the scheme also?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shook his head without offering any verbal comment on the\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen we'll take Case 4,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable pursued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs.\\r\\nSilverdale deliberately poisoned herself, and young Hassendean came by\\r\\nhis end accidentally. In other words, he was shot by either Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale or by a third party\\xe2\\x80\\x94because I doubt if a man could shoot\\r\\nhimself twice over by accident.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shook his head again, more definitely this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn't sound likely, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen his face changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait a bit, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added quickly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that's what happened, she\\r\\nmust have had a motive for suicide. Perhaps someone was on her track,\\r\\nsomebody pretty dangerous; and she saw the game was up. I don't\\r\\nprofess to know how that could happen. But if the man on her heels was\\r\\nthe fellow who did the work with the tourniquet at Heatherfield last\\r\\nnight, she might have thought poison an easier way out of things. It's\\r\\na possibility, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt leaves us hunting for the clue to a purely hypothetical mystery,\\r\\nthough, Inspector, I'm afraid. I don't say you're wrong, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI daresay it's complicated enough already,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted\\r\\nwithout prejudice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, this Case 4 of yours has another flaw in\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x94several, in fact. Unless you take the idea I suggested, it's hard\\r\\nto see why the girl should have had a supply of poison handy at all.\\r\\nIt sounds a bit wild. And you've got to assume that a third party shot\\r\\nyoung Hassendean twice by accident, if a third party came into the\\r\\nbusiness at all. To my mind, that won't wash, sir. It's not good\\r\\nenough. Whereas if it was a case of Mrs. Silverdale shooting him by\\r\\naccident, there was no need for her to commit suicide because of that.\\r\\nNo one knew she was here. She could simply have walked out of the\\r\\nfront door and got clear away with no questions asked. And if she'd\\r\\nalready taken poison, she wouldn't need to shoot herself in the head,\\r\\nwould she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrave objections,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted. It amused him to see the\\r\\nInspector entering so keenly into the game. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we proceed to Case\\r\\n5.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Case 5 is just bunkum,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector pronounced bluntly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\r\\ngets accidentally poisoned; then she gets accidentally shot; then\\r\\nyoung Hassendean suicides. It's too thick altogether.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like the concise way you put it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered with\\r\\nsimulated admiration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo we go on to No. 6, eh? She was deliberately\\r\\nmurdered and he was accidentally shot. What about that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd want to see some motive for the murder, sir, before accepting\\r\\nthat as a possible basis. And if she was deliberately poisoned, what\\r\\nwas the good of young Hassendean dragging her off to the bungalow?\\r\\nThat would throw suspicion straight on to him if he poisoned\\r\\nher. . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough broke off and seemed to think hard for a moment or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a fresh line,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed suddenly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been assuming all\\r\\nalong that either she or young Hassendean used the poison. But it\\r\\nmight have been a third party. I never thought of it in that light,\\r\\nsir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pondered again, while Sir Clinton watched his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might have been someone else altogether, if the poison was a\\r\\nslow-acting one. Someone at Heatherfield perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was only one available person at Heatherfield just then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean the maid, sir? Of course! And that might help to account for\\r\\nher death, too. It might be a case of Judge Lynch, sir. Somebody\\r\\nsquaring the account without bothering us about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNew horizons seemed to be opening up in the Inspector's mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll admit there's something in this method of yours, after all,\\r\\nsir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he conceded gracefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like your \\xe2\\x80\\x98after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Inspector. But at any rate you seem to find\\r\\nthe method suggestive, which is something, at least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt certainly puts ideas into one's mind that one mightn't have\\r\\nthought about otherwise. What about the next case?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCase 7? That's the converse of the last one. He was shot deliberately\\r\\nand she died by accident. What about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would mean, sir, that either she took an overdose of the drug by\\r\\nmistake or someone gave her a fatal dose, ditto. Then either she or a\\r\\nthird party shot young Hassendean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething of the sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! It's no worse than some of the other suggestions. I wonder,\\r\\nnow. . . . She didn't look like a dope-fiend, so far as I could see;\\r\\nbut she might have been just a beginner and taken an overdose by\\r\\naccident. Her eye-pupils were pretty wide-open. That wouldn't fit in\\r\\nwith her snuffing morphine or heroin, but she might have been a\\r\\ncocaine addict, for all we know. . . . This method of yours is very\\r\\nstimulating, sir. It makes one think along fresh lines.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, have another think, Inspector. Case 8: he suicided and she was\\r\\nmurdered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat brings us up against the missing motive again, sir. I'd like to\\r\\nthink over that later on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCase 9, then: He was murdered and she committed suicide. What about\\r\\nthat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me take it bit by bit, sir. First of all, if he was murdered,\\r\\nthen either she did it or a third party did it. If she did it, then\\r\\nshe might have premeditated it, and had her dose of poison with her,\\r\\nready to swallow when she'd shot young Hassendean. That's that. If a\\r\\nthird party murdered young Hassendean, she might have suicided in\\r\\nterror of what was going to happen to her; but that would imply that\\r\\nshe was carrying poison about with her. Also, this third party\\xe2\\x80\\x94whoever\\r\\nhe was\\xe2\\x80\\x94must have had his knife pretty deep in both of them. That's one\\r\\nway of looking at it. But there's another side to the thing as well.\\r\\nSuppose it was one of these suicide-pacts and she took the poison as\\r\\nher part of the bargain; then, before he can swallow his dose, the\\r\\nthird party comes on the scene and shoots him. That might be a\\r\\npossibility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the third party obligingly removed the superfluous dose of\\r\\npoison, for some inscrutable reason of his own, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! It seems silly, doesn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, unlikely things do happen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm no\\r\\nstickler for probability in crime. One so seldom finds it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough took his notebook from his pocket and entered in it a copy\\r\\nof Sir Clinton's classification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll have another think about this later on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as he finished\\r\\nwriting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't think much of it when you showed it to me at first,\\r\\nbut it certainly seems to be one way of getting a few ideas to test.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow let's look at the thing from another point of view,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nsuggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssume that young Hassendean and Mrs. Silverdale were in\\r\\nthe room of the bungalow. There were traces of somebody at the\\r\\nside-window, and someone certainly broke the glass of the front\\r\\nwindow. By the way, Inspector, when you went over young Hassendean's\\r\\nclothes finally last night, did you find a key-ring or anything of\\r\\nthat sort?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had a few keys\\xe2\\x80\\x94the latchkey of Ivy Lodge, and one or two more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll need to make sure that the key of the bungalow was amongst\\r\\nthem, because if it wasn't, then he may have had to break in\\xe2\\x80\\x94which\\r\\nwould account for the window. But I'm pretty certain he didn't do\\r\\nthat. He'd been up beforehand with these flowers in the afternoon,\\r\\ngetting the place ready. It's most improbable that he hadn't the key\\r\\nof the front door with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll see to it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector assured him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the meantime, just let's assume that the broken window represents\\r\\nthe work of a third party. What do you make of things on that basis?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is there to make out of them except one thing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\ndemanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the side window you had somebody whom you christened\\r\\nPeeping Tom; at the front window was a second person who got so\\r\\nexcited that he broke into the room. You're not trying to make out\\r\\nthat these two characters were filled by one person, are you, sir?\\r\\nThere would be no point in Peeping Tom leaving his window and walking\\r\\nround to the front one before breaking in. Either window was good\\r\\nenough for that. He'd no need to shift his ground.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton assured him in a thoughtful tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn't looking\\r\\nat it from that angle. I was merely wondering where Mr. Justice came\\r\\nin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean whether he was Peeping Tom or t'other?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething of that sort,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable answered. Then, changing\\r\\nthe subject, he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat bits of information are you going to hunt\\r\\nfor next, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough ran over some points in his mind and cleared his throat\\r\\nbefore speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, I want to know what this poison was, where it came\\r\\nfrom, and how long it takes to act. I expect to get something from the\\r\\nP.M. results, and we can always send some of the organs for analysis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded his agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we'll get two people on to that part of the thing\\r\\nindependently. Say a London man and perhaps one of the chemists at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute here. We'll need to see this fellow Markfield\\r\\nin any case, just to check the statements that Ringwood gave us, and\\r\\nwhen we're doing that we can find out if there's anyone capable of\\r\\ndoing the analysis for us. Perhaps Markfield himself might take it\\r\\non.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector, seeing that Sir Clinton was waiting for him to\\r\\ncontinue, proceeded with his list of evidence required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll put Yarrow on to the matter of young Hassendean's pistol\\r\\nlicense. That won't take long to look up, and it will help to clinch\\r\\nthe fact that it really was his pistol that we found on the floor. I\\r\\ndon't suppose for a moment that it was brought in from the outside.\\r\\nThe loose ammunition in the drawer seems convincing on that point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm quite with you there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I want to look into the maid's affairs and see if she had any\\r\\ngrudge against Mrs. Silverdale. It's a pity the second maid's so ill.\\r\\nWe can't get anything out of her for a while, I'm afraid. And I want\\r\\nher for another thing: to see if Mrs. Silverdale doped herself at all.\\r\\nBut I expect, if she did, that I'll be able to pick up some hint of it\\r\\nsomewhere or other. And of course, if the poison turns out to be a\\r\\nnon-dope kind, that line of inquiry drops into a subsidiary place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable encouraged him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I'll send a man up to try the keys we found in young\\r\\nHassendean's pocket on the lock of the bungalow door, just to clear up\\r\\nthe broken window matter. That won't take long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I suppose I'll need to make a try at finding out who Peeping\\r\\nTom was and also your Mr. Justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite a lot of suggestions you seem to have extracted from my little\\r\\nlist of possibilities, Inspector. I think you owe it an apology for\\r\\nthe rather contemptuous way you approached it at first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, it's been more suggestive than I expected, I admit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne thing's certain, Inspector. The solution of the affair must lie\\r\\nsomewhere on that little table. It's simply a matter of picking out\\r\\nthe proper case. The odds at most are eight to one and they're really\\r\\nless than that if one discards some of the very improbable\\r\\ncombinations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desk-telephone rang sharply, and Sir Clinton listened to the\\r\\nmessage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat interests you, Inspector. A report's come in that Mr. Silverdale\\r\\ncame home and has gone down to the Croft-Thornton. He mentioned where\\r\\nhe was going to the constable in charge at Heatherfield, and he very\\r\\nthoughtfully suggested that as the Croft-Thornton is quite near here,\\r\\nit would be easy for us to interview him there if we desired to do so.\\r\\nThe perfect little gentleman, in fact. Well, what about it,\\r\\nInspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose I'd better go at once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough proposed after a glance\\r\\nat his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'll include myself in the invitation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nvolunteered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, by the way, you'd better take that fly-in-the-amber\\r\\ncigarette-holder with you, if they've finished with it downstairs.\\r\\nYoung Hassendean was working at the Croft-Thornton and someone there\\r\\nmay be able to identify it for us if it was his. I'm not anxious to\\r\\ntrouble his relations in the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough acquiesced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll want your car. I'll\\r\\ngive the order for it now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fly in the Amber\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the door of the big block of buildings which formed the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute, Inspector Flamborough made inquiries from\\r\\nthe porter and obtained a guide through the labyrinth of stairs and\\r\\ncorridors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Dr. Markfield's laboratory, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their pilot finally\\r\\ninformed them as he knocked on a door. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo gentlemen to see you,\\r\\nsir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced, standing aside to allow Sir Clinton and the\\r\\nInspector to enter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked into the laboratory, Trevor Markfield came towards them\\r\\nfrom one of the benches at which he had been occupied. His face\\r\\nbetrayed his slight surprise at finding two strangers before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can I do for you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired politely, but without any\\r\\nneedless effusiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, in response to an almost imperceptible gesture from his\\r\\nsuperior, stepped to the front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Sir Clinton Driffield, the Chief Constable, Dr. Markfield.\\r\\nI'm Inspector Flamborough. We've called to see if you could give us\\r\\nsome expert assistance in a case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield, after a glance at a water-bath on which a flask was being\\r\\nheated, led the way to a little office which adjoined the laboratory\\r\\nand closed the door behind the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall be more private here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, inviting them with a gesture\\r\\nto take chairs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of my assistants will be back shortly, and I take\\r\\nit that your business is likely to be confidential.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector agreed with a nod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a poisoning case and we'll need some help in detecting the\\r\\npoison.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a bit vague,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield commented with a smile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are so\\r\\nmany kinds of poisons, you know. If it's arsenic or anything of that\\r\\nsort, a first-year student could spot it for you; but if it's one of\\r\\nthe organic lot, it'll be a stiff business most likely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks like one of the mydriatic alkaloids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton put in.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAtropine, or something akin to it. The eye-pupils of the body were\\r\\ndilated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield considered for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've done some alkaloid work in my time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\nsuppose in a case of this kind you ought to have the best man. Some of\\r\\nthe alkaloids are the very devil to spot when you've only a small\\r\\nquantity. I'd like the fee for the case, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added with a\\r\\nfaint smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the truth is that Dr. Silverdale, my chief, is an\\r\\nalkaloid specialist. He's worked on them for years, and he could give\\r\\nme points all along the line. I'll take you along to his room now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose from his chair, but a gesture from Flamborough arrested him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid that would hardly do, Dr. Markfield. As a matter of fact,\\r\\nit's Mrs. Silverdale's death that we're inquiring into!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield could not repress an exclamation at the Inspector's\\r\\nstatement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Silverdale? You don't mean to say that anything's happened to\\r\\nher? Good God! I knew the girl quite well. Nobody could have a grudge\\r\\nagainst her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced from one official to the other, as though doubting his\\r\\nears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, after a moment's pause. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I've taken\\r\\nyou up wrong. Do you mean Yvonne Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face showed a struggle between incredulity and belief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that girl hadn't an enemy in the world, man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he broke out at\\r\\nlast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe thing's clean impossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've just seen her body,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blunt statement seemed to have its effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if that's so, you can count on me for any work you want me to\\r\\ndo. I'm quite willing to take it on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's very satisfactory, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton interposed.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, perhaps you could give us help in another line as well. You seem\\r\\nto have been a friend of Mrs. Silverdale's. Could you tell us anything\\r\\nabout her\\xe2\\x80\\x94anything you think might be useful to us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA fresh thought seemed to pass through Markfield's mind and a faint\\r\\nsuggestion of distrust appeared on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I'm ready to answer any questions you care to put,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nthough there seemed to be a certain reluctance in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's attitude indicated that it was the turn of the\\r\\nInspector. Flamborough pulled out his notebook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, then, Dr. Markfield, could you tell us when you first\\r\\nbecame acquainted with Mrs. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShortly after she and her husband came to Westerhaven. That's about\\r\\nthree years ago, roughly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou knew her fairly well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI used to see her at dances and so forth. Lately, I've seen less of\\r\\nher. She picked up other friends, naturally; and I don't dance much\\r\\nnowadays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe danced a good deal, I understand. Can you tell me any particular\\r\\npeople who associated with her frequently in recent times?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI daresay I could give you a list of several. Young Hassendean was\\r\\none. She used him as a kind of dancing-partner, from all I heard; but\\r\\nI go out so little nowadays that I can't speak from much direct\\r\\nknowledge on the point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of person was Mrs. Silverdale, in your judgment?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield took a little time to consider this question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was French, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always found her very\\r\\nbright. Some people called her frivolous. She was out to enjoy\\r\\nherself, of course. Naturally she was a bit out of place in a\\r\\nbackwater like this. She got some people's backs up, I believe. Women\\r\\ndidn't like her being so smartly-dressed and all that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any reason to suppose that she took drugs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield listened to this question with obvious amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrugs? No. She'd never touch drugs. Who's been putting that lie\\r\\naround?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough tactfully disregarded this question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen from what you know of her, you would say that suicide would be\\r\\nimprobable in her case?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite, I should say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had no worries that you know of, no domestic troubles, for\\r\\ninstance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's eyes narrowed slightly at the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHardly my business to discuss another man's affairs, is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ndemanded, obviously annoyed by the Inspector's query. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't think\\r\\nI'm called upon to repeat the tittle-tattle of the town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean you don't know anything personally?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean I'm not inclined to gossip about the domestic affairs of a\\r\\ncolleague. If you're so keen on them, you can go and ask him direct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite evident that Markfield had strong views on the subject of\\r\\nwhat he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctittle-tattle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and the Inspector realised that\\r\\nnothing would be gained by pursuing the matter. At the same time, he\\r\\nwas amused to see that Markfield, by his loyalty to his colleague, had\\r\\nbetrayed the very thing which he was trying to conceal. It was obvious\\r\\nthat things had not gone smoothly in the Silverdale household, or\\r\\nMarkfield would have had no reason for burking the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mentioned young Hassendean's name,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nknow that he's been murdered, of course?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw it in the paper this morning. He's no great loss,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield\\r\\nsaid brutally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had him here in the Institute, and a more useless\\r\\npup you'd be hard put to it to find.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of person was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of these bumptious brats who think they ought to have everything\\r\\nthey want, just for the asking. He'd a very bad swelled head.\\r\\nHerring-gutted, too, I should judge. He used to bore me with a lot of\\r\\nromantic drivel until I sat on him hard once or twice. I couldn't\\r\\nstand him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident that young Hassendean had rasped Markfield's nerves\\r\\nbadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad anyone a grudge against him, do you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shouldn't be surprised, knowing him as I did. He would have put a\\r\\nsaint's back up with his bounce and impertinence. But if you mean a\\r\\ngrudge big enough to lead to murder, I can't say. I saw as little of\\r\\nhim as possible even in working hours, and I had no interest in his\\r\\nprivate affairs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite evident that nothing of real value was to be elicited\\r\\nalong this line. The Inspector abandoned the subject of young\\r\\nHassendean's personality and turned to a fresh field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYoung Hassendean smoked cigarettes, didn't he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've seen him smoking them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this his holder, by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough produced the fly-in-amber holder as he spoke and laid it\\r\\non the table. As he did so, he glanced at Markfield's face and was\\r\\nsurprised to see the swift change of expression on it. A flash of\\r\\namazement followed by something that looked like dismay, crossed his\\r\\nfeatures; then, almost instantaneously, he composed himself, and only\\r\\na faint trace of misgiving showed in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, that isn't young Hassendean's holder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou recognise it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield bent forward to inspect the article, but it was evident that\\r\\nhe knew it well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo I need to answer these questions of yours?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded,\\r\\nuncomfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll have that question put to you at the inquest when you're on\\r\\nyour oath,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector sharply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may as well answer now\\r\\nand save trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield stared for a moment longer at the fly in the amber.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere did you pick this thing up?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded, without answering the\\r\\nInspector's question.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Flamborough saw that he had got on the track of something definite\\r\\nat last, and was not inclined to be put off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's our business, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said brusquely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou recognise the\\r\\nthing, obviously. Whose is it? It's no use trying to shield anyone.\\r\\nThe thing's too conspicuous; and if you don't tell us about it,\\r\\nsomeone else will. But it doesn't look well to find you trying to\\r\\nthrow dust in our eyes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield could not help seeing that the Inspector attached special\\r\\nimportance to the holder; and he evidently recognised that further\\r\\nshuffling was out of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not going to identify it for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've let slip that\\r\\nit's an important clue; and I don't know it well enough to make\\r\\nassertions about it. I'll send for a man now who'll be able to swear\\r\\ndefinitely, one way or another. That's all I see my way to do for\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his hand on a bell-push and they waited in silence until a boy\\r\\ncame in answer to the summons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend Gilling to me at once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when the boy had withdrawn, he turned to the two officials\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGilling is our head mechanic. You can question him about it. He's an\\r\\nintelligent man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes the mechanic appeared at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wanted me, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield introduced the Inspector with a gesture, and Flamborough put\\r\\nhis questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've seen this thing before?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mechanic came forward to the table and examined the holder\\r\\ncarefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I made it myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're quite sure of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo mistake about it. I know my own work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell us what you know about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mechanic thought for a moment or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was about three months ago, sir. If you want it, I can look up the\\r\\nexact date in my workshop notebook where I keep a record of each day's\\r\\nwork. I made two of them for Dr. Silverdale at that time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shot a glance at Markfield's downcast face. It was pretty\\r\\nobvious now who was being shielded; and the Inspector remembered how\\r\\nMarkfield had fenced in the matter of the domestic troubles of the\\r\\nSilverdales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell us exactly what happened then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough encouraged the\\r\\nmechanic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Silverdale came to me one morning with some bits of stuff in his\\r\\nhand\\xe2\\x80\\x94amber-looking, same as this holder. He told me he'd been\\r\\nmanufacturing some new stuff\\xe2\\x80\\x94a condensate like Bakelite. He wanted me\\r\\nto see if it could be filed and turned and so on. I remember his\\r\\nshowing me the fly, there. He'd put it into the stuff as a joke\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fly\\r\\nto prove that the thing was genuine amber, and take people in when he\\r\\nshowed the stuff to them. The condensate stuff was in sticks, two of\\r\\nthem, about six inches long by an inch thick, so he suggested that I'd\\r\\nbetter make two cigarette-holders and see if the thing would stand\\r\\nbeing worked on a lathe without splitting or cracking. So I made the\\r\\ntwo holders for him. I remember the trouble I had to steer clear of\\r\\nthe fly while I was shaping the thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what happened to the holders after that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Silverdale used the one with no fly in it for a bit and kept the\\r\\nother one for show. Then he lost the plain one\\xe2\\x80\\x94he's always leaving his\\r\\nholders about the place on the benches\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he took to using the one\\r\\nwith the fly in it. He's been smoking with it for a month or more,\\r\\nnow. I remember just last week asking him whether it was wearing well,\\r\\nwhen he came into the workshop with it in his mouth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave another good look at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to be\\r\\nsure there's no mistake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGilling examined the holder once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's the one I made, sir. I could swear to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated a moment as if wishing to ask a question; but\\r\\nFlamborough, having got his information, dismissed the mechanic\\r\\nwithout more ado. When the man had gone, he turned back to Markfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't quite like your way of doing things, Dr. Markfield. You might\\r\\nhave given us the information at once without all this shuffling, for\\r\\nI could see at a glance you had recognised this cigarette-holder. If\\r\\nyou're trying to shield your colleague from a reasonable\\r\\ninvestigation, I'll take the liberty of reminding you that one can\\r\\nbecome an accessory after the fact as well as before it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face grew stormy as he listened to the Inspector's\\r\\nwarning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd have a look at the law on slander, if I were you, Inspector,\\r\\nbefore you start flinging accusations about. If you remember the\\r\\nfacts, it'll help. I've only seen this holder at a distance when Dr.\\r\\nSilverdale was using it. I've never had a good look at it until you\\r\\nproduced it. Naturally, although I had very little doubt about whose\\r\\nit was, still I wasn't going to assert that it was Silverdale's. But I\\r\\ngot you a man who could identify it properly. What more do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face showed that he found this defence quite\\r\\nunsatisfactory. Markfield's obvious fencing with him at the start had\\r\\nleft its impression on his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, when you do this analysis for us, remember that you'll have to\\r\\ntestify about it in the witness-box,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, bluntly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can't have\\r\\nany qualifications and fine distinctions then, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll be quite prepared to stand over any results I get,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield\\r\\nasserted with equal bluntness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I don't guarantee to find a poison\\r\\nif it isn't there, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere _is_ something there, according to the doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\ndeclared. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I think I'd like to see Dr. Silverdale, if you can tell\\r\\nus where to find him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's temper was evidently still ruffled, and he was obviously\\r\\nglad to be rid of the Inspector. He conducted them along a passage,\\r\\npointed out a door, and then took leave of them in the curtest\\r\\nfashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the room which had been shown to them; and while\\r\\nFlamborough was explaining who they were, Sir Clinton had leisure to\\r\\nexamine Silverdale. He saw an alert, athletic man with a friendly\\r\\nmanner, who looked rather younger than his thirty-five years. Whatever\\r\\nSilverdale's domestic troubles might have been, he showed few outward\\r\\nsigns of them. When they disturbed him, he had been sitting before a\\r\\ndelicate balance; and as he rose, he slid the glass front down in\\r\\norder to protect the instrument. Apart from his surroundings, it would\\r\\nhave been difficult to determine his profession; for he had an\\r\\nopen-air skin which certainly did not suggest the laboratory. He\\r\\ncarried himself well, and only a yellow stain of picric acid on the\\r\\nright-hand side of his old tweed laboratory jacket detracted from his\\r\\nspruceness and betrayed the chemist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been expecting you, Inspector Flamborough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as soon as\\r\\nhe realised who his visitors were. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has been a dreadful business\\r\\nlast night. It was a bolt from the blue to me when I got home this\\r\\nmorning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, and looked inquiringly at the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any notion why that unfortunate maid of mine was murdered?\\r\\nIt's a complete mystery to me. A dreadful business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough exchanged a glance with the Chief Constable. As Silverdale\\r\\nhad ignored his wife's death, it seemed to the Inspector that the news\\r\\nof it might be broken to him later, when the other case had been dealt\\r\\nwith. Silverdale, of course, could hardly have picked up any hint\\r\\nabout the affairs at the bungalow, since a knowledge of them was still\\r\\nconfined to the police and Dr. Ringwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're rather at a loss at present,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted frankly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs\\r\\nthings stand, it looks rather like a case of a detected burglar who\\r\\nkilled the woman when she disturbed him at his work. Had you any stock\\r\\nof valuables on your premises which might have attracted gentry of\\r\\nthat sort?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy wife had a certain amount of jewellery, but I don't think any\\r\\nburglar would have found it worth while to go the length of murder for\\r\\nthe sake of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere did Mrs. Silverdale keep her jewellery?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rather think it's kept in one of the drawers of an old\\r\\nchest-of-drawers in her room\\xe2\\x80\\x94the drawer that the man broke into. But\\r\\nshe may have other things elsewhere. We had different rooms, you know;\\r\\nand I never troubled to find out where she put things in her own\\r\\nroom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you couldn't give us a list of your wife's jewellery?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I really don't know what she has. I could tell you one or two\\r\\nthings, of course; but I couldn't guarantee to remember them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough switched off to a fresh line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis maid of yours was reliable? I mean, she couldn't have been a\\r\\nconfederate of the burglar by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite out of the question, I should say. That maid had been with us\\r\\never since we were married; and before that she'd been in service with\\r\\nan aunt of mine who died. She'd always had a good character, and she\\r\\nwas old enough not to do anything silly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn old family retainer? I see, sir. And you never had any friction\\r\\nwith her, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough returned to his earlier line of inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can't think of anything else a burglar might have had his eye on\\r\\nin your house, sir? Apart from the jewellery, I mean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale seemed taken aback by the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't quite understand, I'm afraid. What could a burglar want\\r\\nexcept jewellery or plate? And he might take all the plate I keep away\\r\\nwith him and not be much the richer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough seemed unable to think of any fresh question to put on\\r\\nthat particular subject. His face took on a new expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid we've got worse news for you, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began, and in a few\\r\\nsentences he put Silverdale in possession of the barest outline of the\\r\\nbungalow tragedy. Sir Clinton, watching the manner in which the\\r\\nbereaved husband received the news, had to confess to himself that he\\r\\ncould make nothing of what he saw. Silverdale's manner and words were\\r\\njust what might have been expected in the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough allowed a decent interval to elapse before he came\\r\\ndirectly to business once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Dr. Silverdale, I'm sorry I've got to ask some awkward\\r\\nquestions; but I'm sure you'll give us your best help in clearing up\\r\\nthis affair. I hate to worry you\\xe2\\x80\\x94I'm sure you understand that\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it's\\r\\nessential that we should get certain information at the earliest\\r\\npossible moment. That's my excuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Silverdale could reply, the door of the laboratory opened, and\\r\\na slim, graceful girl came into the room. At the sight of the two\\r\\nstrangers, she halted shyly. Sir Clinton caught a gleam in\\r\\nSilverdale's expression as he turned towards the girl: a touch of\\r\\nsomething difficult to define.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust a moment, Miss Deepcar, please. I'm engaged just now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI only came to tell you that I'd taken that mixed melting-point. It's\\r\\nhyoscine picrate, as you thought it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThanks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale returned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll come round to your room in a few\\r\\nminutes. Please wait for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in the brief exchange of information seemed to have\\r\\nattracted Sir Clinton's attention. He glanced at the girl as she\\r\\nturned to leave the room; then he appeared to re-concentrate his mind\\r\\nupon Flamborough's questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Dr. Silverdale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is a very nasty\\r\\nbusiness, and I don't mind admitting that we're in the dark just now.\\r\\nCan you think of anything which might connect the deaths of the maid\\r\\nand Mrs. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale stared at the floor for a time, as though turning\\r\\npossibilities over in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't imagine how there could be any connection whatever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\nat last.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough decided to approach the most awkward part of his subject.\\r\\nIt was impossible to tell from his manner what was coming next, but it\\r\\nwas clear that he had something important to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Dr. Silverdale, I want to be as tactful as I can; but if I go\\r\\nover the score, I hope you'll take the will for the deed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, you can be as blunt as you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale retorted, with the\\r\\nfirst signs of impatience which he had shown. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk what you choose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThanks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector answered with apparent relief. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I'll come\\r\\nstraight to the point. What precisely were the relations existing\\r\\nbetween Mrs. Silverdale and young Hassendean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale's face paled slightly and his lips tightened as this blunt\\r\\nresponse to his offer fell on his ears. He seemed to consider his\\r\\nreply carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you mean: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Was she unfaithful to me with young Hassendean?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThen my answer would be: \\xe2\\x80\\x98So far as my information goes, no.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She\\r\\nflirted with the young cub certainly; and they behaved, to my mind,\\r\\nvery injudiciously; but to the best of my knowledge it went no further\\r\\nthan that. I'd have brought them up with a round turn if they'd given\\r\\nme cause.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's your candid opinion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're keeping\\r\\nback nothing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, man, I'd have given . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale broke out. Then he stopped\\r\\nshort in mid-sentence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's my candid opinion, as you put it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nended tamely.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, it seemed, had extracted the information he wanted. He\\r\\nleft the subject and took up a fresh one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you recall anything important which happened in the year 1925?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I left London and took up my post here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were married in 1923, weren't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad your wife any relations in this country? She was French, wasn't\\r\\nshe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had a brother, Octave Renard, who was in business in London.\\r\\nStill is, as a matter of fact. An old aunt is the only other relation\\r\\nI know of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore you left London, had you any difficulties with Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale\\xe2\\x80\\x94I mean anything like young Hassendean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing that came to my notice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale answered, after\\r\\nconsulting his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you recall any friend of yours or of hers who had the initial B?\\r\\nEither in the Christian name or the surname, I mean. It might be\\r\\neither a man or a woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis question evidently surprised Silverdale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe initial B?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I can't recall anyone to fit that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to be running over a list of people in his mind, but at the\\r\\nend of half-a-minute he shook his head decidedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I can't think of anyone with that initial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face betrayed his dissatisfaction. He had evidently\\r\\nbuilt some hopes on getting the information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, another point, Dr. Silverdale. Have you any reason to suppose\\r\\nthat Mrs. Silverdale was addicted to drugs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time, Silverdale's surprise at the question was quite unfeigned:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrugs? Of course not! Unless you count cocktails as drugs. What on\\r\\nearth put that into your mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector rather shamefacedly abandoned this line of inquiry, and\\r\\nturned to something else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd like to hear anything you can tell me about young Hassendean,\\r\\nsir. He worked here in the Institute, didn't he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat depends a good deal on what precise meaning you attach to the\\r\\nword \\xe2\\x80\\x98work,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Inspector. He certainly loafed about the premises, but he\\r\\ndid as little as he could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Flamborough, impatiently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan you tell me anything else\\r\\nabout him? Everyone I've interviewed yet has told me he was idle. I'd\\r\\nrather have something more to the point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale thought for a moment or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was a nuisance from the start. When he came here first\\xe2\\x80\\x94some three\\r\\nyears ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94he spent his time hanging round one of the girl-assistants:\\r\\nMiss Hailsham. He interfered with her work, and I had to speak to him\\r\\nabout it several times. Then she got engaged to him. Some time after,\\r\\nmy wife took him up, and he broke off his engagement to Miss\\r\\nHailsham\\xe2\\x80\\x94possibly to please my wife. I remember it made things rather\\r\\nunpleasant here when the engagement was broken, because Miss Hailsham\\r\\ntook it rather badly. She'd every reason to do so, though she wasn't\\r\\nlosing much, it seemed to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough pricked up his ears at this information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this Miss Hailsham still an assistant here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's one of my private assistants. I\\r\\nhave several girls who do routine work; but Miss Hailsham and Miss\\r\\nDeepcar\\xe2\\x80\\x94the girl who came in here a moment ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94are a shade better than\\r\\nthe usual run.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould you make an excuse to let me have a look at Miss Hailsham?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nFlamborough inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's not here to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOff with a sore throat,\\r\\nor something of that sort. But if you'll come back another time, I can\\r\\ntake you to her room if you wish. You can pose as a visitor whom I'm\\r\\nshowing round, if you don't want to appear officially.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. I'll drop in some other day. Now, another point, if\\r\\nyou don't mind. Mrs. Silverdale wore a signet ring. Can you tell me\\r\\nanything about it? Did she get it from you or did she buy it herself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't make her a present of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale answered promptly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nbelieve she got it made by some jeweller or other. I remember a few\\r\\nyears ago she took it into her head to seal all her letters\\xe2\\x80\\x94some\\r\\npassing fad in the crowd she used to associate with, I suppose. But\\r\\nonce she started doing it, she kept it up. I think she must have got\\r\\nthe signet ring made for that purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough nodded thoughtfully as though he attached some\\r\\nimportance to this information. Then, in a casual tone he inquired:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou weren't at home last night, of course? Where were you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a thought seemed to cross Silverdale's mind and he halted\\r\\nabruptly in his sentence. Then he amended his statement most\\r\\nobviously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI spent the night working here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough noted the words in his pocket-book with marked\\r\\ndeliberation. Then he looked round the room and seemed dissatisfied\\r\\nwith something. As though to give himself time to think before asking\\r\\nanother question, he moved over to the window and gazed down\\r\\nthoughtfully into the main thoroughfare below. Whatever his\\r\\nreflections may have been, the result of them was singularly feeble.\\r\\nHe turned back to Silverdale and put a final question:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you can't think of any other point that might help us to\\r\\nthrow light on this business, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale shook his head decidedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm quite in the dark about it all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector looked him up and down deliberately for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, in that case, sir, I don't think we need take up any more of\\r\\nyour time. I'll remove the police from your house. It's been\\r\\ndisinfected already by the sanitary people, so you can go back there\\r\\nany time you choose, now. Thanks for the help you've given us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough did not speak to Sir Clinton until they had put the length\\r\\nof a corridor between themselves and Silverdale's laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'll drop in and see Dr. Markfield again, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not at all satisfied about some things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo so, Inspector. I quite agree with you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll make an excuse about the arrangements for this analysis. Not\\r\\nthat I'll lay much stress on Markfield's results when we get them,\\r\\nsir. He's made a bad impression on me over that evidence he gave us\\r\\nbefore. People shouldn't equivocate in a murder case merely to shield\\r\\ntheir friends. We've troubles enough without that sort of thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, handle him tactfully, Inspector, or he may turn stubborn. If he\\r\\ntakes refuge in \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don't remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or anything of that sort, you'll\\r\\nnot get much out of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton observed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shan't frighten him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough assured him, as they approached\\r\\nMarkfield's room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they entered, Markfield looked up in surprise at seeing them once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's just occurred to me that I forgot to make arrangements about\\r\\nhanding that stuff over to you for analysis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough said, as he\\r\\nwent forward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt'll be in sealed jars, of course; and I'd prefer to\\r\\nhand it over to you personally. I suppose I could always get hold of\\r\\nyou either here or at your house?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'd better come here. My housekeeper's away just now nursing some\\r\\nrelation who's down with 'flu, and my house is empty except when I\\r\\nhappen to be at home myself. You'll find me here between nine in the\\r\\nmorning and six at night\\xe2\\x80\\x94except for lunch-time, of course. I generally\\r\\nclear out of here at six and dine down town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you have a long enough day of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector said in a\\r\\ncasual tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don't come back here and work in the evening?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes, if there's something interesting that brings me back. But\\r\\nI haven't done that for weeks past.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis place is shut up at night, isn't it? I mean, you don't keep a\\r\\nporter or a watchman on the premises?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. But each of the seniors has a private key, of course. I can get\\r\\nin any time I wish. It's the same at the Research Station.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector seemed to be struck by an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny valuable stuff on the premises, by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing a thief could make much out of. There's a thousand or fifteen\\r\\nhundred pounds worth of platinum, dishes, electrodes, and so forth, in\\r\\nthe safe. I believe the man on the beat is supposed to give special\\r\\nattention to the place and notify anything suspicious immediately; but\\r\\nI've never known anything of the sort to happen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather a difficult position for our men if the staff can come and go\\r\\nfreely at night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a constable sees a\\r\\nlight in the window, what's he to make of it? Does Dr. Silverdale work\\r\\nlate often?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really couldn't tell you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don't see much of him privately, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery little,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly when I run across him by\\r\\naccident down town, like last night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou met him, did you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHardly even that. I happened to drop into the Grosvenor for dinner\\r\\nafter I left here. I can't get meals at home just now unless I cook\\r\\n'em myself. As I was finishing my coffee, Silverdale came into the\\r\\ndining-room with Miss Deepcar and took a table in the window recess. I\\r\\ndidn't disturb them, and I don't think they noticed me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen they were just beginning dinner when you left the place? What\\r\\ntime was that, can you tell me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield looked suspiciously at the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're trying to get me to say something that you want to use\\r\\nagainst\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, someone else, shall we say? I don't care about it,\\r\\nfrankly. But since you could get the information from the waiter who\\r\\nserved them, there's no harm done. I went to the Grosvenor at 6.35 or\\r\\nthereabouts. I was going down to the Research Station afterwards to\\r\\npick up some notes, so I dined early that night. Silverdale and Miss\\r\\nDeepcar came in just as I was finishing dinner\\xe2\\x80\\x94that would be about a\\r\\nquarter past seven or thereby. I expect they were going on to some\\r\\nshow afterwards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas she in evening dress?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk me another. I never can tell whether a girl's in evening dress or\\r\\nnot, nowadays, with these new fashions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough closed his notebook and took his leave, followed\\r\\nby Sir Clinton. When they reached the street again and had got into\\r\\nthe waiting car, the Chief Constable turned to his subordinate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou collected a lot of interesting information that time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI noticed you left it all to me, sir; but I think I got one or two\\r\\nthings worth having. It's a bit disconnected; and it'll take some\\r\\nthinking before it's straightened out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat's your main inference, as things stand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, it's a bit early yet. But I've been wondering about one\\r\\nthing, certainly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that is whether Peeping Tom's name wasn't Thomasina,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\nannounced gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are two sexes, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted with equal\\r\\ngravity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd inquisitiveness is supposed to be more strongly\\r\\ndeveloped in the female than in the male. The next thing will be to\\r\\nconsider whether Mr. Justice shouldn't be rechristened Justitia. One\\r\\nought to take all possibilities into account.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hassendean Journal\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ronald Hassendean's journal was found to consist of four bulky\\r\\nvolumes of manuscript, Sir Clinton hastily disclaimed any desire to\\r\\nmake its acquaintance _in extenso_ and passed over to Inspector\\r\\nFlamborough the task of ploughing through it in detail and selecting\\r\\nthose passages which seemed to have direct bearing on the case. The\\r\\nInspector took the diary home with him and spent a laborious evening,\\r\\nlightened at times by flashes of cynical enjoyment when the writer\\r\\nlaid bare certain aspects of his soul. Next day Flamborough presented\\r\\nhimself at Sir Clinton's office with the books under his arm; and the\\r\\npaper slips which he had used as markers made a formidable array as\\r\\nthey projected from the edges of the volumes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Lord!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the Chief Constable in consternation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you\\r\\nmean to say I ought to read through about a hundred and fifty passages\\r\\nin inferior handwriting? Life's too short for that. Take 'em away,\\r\\nInspector, and get someone to write me a _pr\\xc3\\xa9cis_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's lips opened into a broad smile under his toothbrush\\r\\nmoustache.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not really so bad as it looks, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe white\\r\\nslips were put in to mark anything that seemed to bear remotely on the\\r\\nbusiness; but the passages directly relevant to the affair are\\r\\nindicated by red slips. I think you ought to glance through that last\\r\\nlot. There aren't really very many of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe deposited the volumes on Sir Clinton's desk so that the\\r\\nmarking-tabs projected towards his superior. Sir Clinton eyed them\\r\\nwithout any enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I suppose duty calls, Inspector. I'll go over them with you,\\r\\njust in case you want to give me any special points drawn from your\\r\\ngeneral reading in the Works of Hassendean. If you've got a morbid\\r\\ncraving for voluminous writers, you'd better start on the _Faerie\\r\\nQueene_. It, also, leads up to the death of a Blatant Beast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI read a bit of it at school, sir. I'm keeping the rest for a rainy\\r\\nday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton again eyed the four stout volumes with unconcealed\\r\\naversion. Quite obviously he was ready to catch at anything in order\\r\\nto postpone the examination of them, even now that he had decided to\\r\\nsubmit to the Inspector's ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore I start on this stuff, there are one or two points I want to\\r\\nget cleared up. First of all, did you get any reports in reply to our\\r\\ninquiries about young Hassendean's car being seen on the roads that\\r\\nnight?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. The only motor information we got was about one car that was\\r\\nstolen under cover of the fog. It's being looked into. Oh, yes, and\\r\\nthere was an inquiry for the name and address of the owner of a car.\\r\\nIt seems somebody got hit by a motor and managed to take its number. I\\r\\ndon't think any real damage was done. It's just one of these try-on\\r\\ncases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething more important now. Did you find out from the man on the\\r\\nbeat whether there was a light in Silverdale's room at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton on the night of the murders?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you come to think of that, sir? I didn't mention it to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was just a long shot, Inspector. As soon as Silverdale stated that\\r\\nhe had been working all that night at the Croft-Thornton, I was pretty\\r\\nsure he was lying. So were you, I guessed. Then you walked across to\\r\\nthe window and looked down. As I was wondering myself whether the\\r\\nwindow was visible from the street, it didn't take much mind-reading\\r\\nto see what you were driving at. And from your questions to Markfield\\r\\nlater on, I couldn't help inferring that you had the constable on the\\r\\nbeat at the back of your thoughts. Obviously you meant to check\\r\\nSilverdale's story by asking the constable on duty if he'd noticed a\\r\\nlight in Silverdale's room that night. There was no light, of course?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. There wasn't a light anywhere in the building, that night. I\\r\\nmade the constable look up his notebook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you've caught Master Silverdale in a very bad lie. By the way, I\\r\\nsuppose you noticed that girl who came into his room while we were\\r\\ntalking to him: the Miss Deepcar who dined with him down town that\\r\\nnight. What did you make of her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPretty girl, sir, very pretty indeed. The quiet sort, I'd judge. One\\r\\nof the kind that a man might do a good deal to get hold of, if he was\\r\\nkeen on her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's expression showed that he did not disagree with the\\r\\nInspector's summing up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid you take any note of what she said to\\r\\nSilverdale at that time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot particularly, sir. It was all Greek to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94too technical.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt interested me, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've a chemical\\r\\nfriend\\xe2\\x80\\x94the London man who's going to act as a check on Markfield for\\r\\nus in the search for the poison, as a matter of fact\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he talks to\\r\\nme occasionally about chemistry. You don't know what a \\xe2\\x80\\x98mixed\\r\\nmelting-point\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. It sounds confused,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector mischievously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable treated this as beneath contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll explain the point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pursued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand then you'll know as much as\\r\\nI do. A pure substance melts at a higher temperature than it does when\\r\\nit's contaminated by even a trace of some foreign material. Suppose\\r\\nthat you had been given a stuff which you thought was pure quinine and\\r\\nyou had no chemicals handy to do the ordinary tests for quinine. What\\r\\nyou'd do would be this. You'd take the melting-point of your sample\\r\\nfirst of all. Then to the sample you'd add a trace of something which\\r\\nyou knew definitely was quinine\\xe2\\x80\\x94a specimen from your laboratory stock,\\r\\nsay. Then you'd take the melting-point of this mixture. Suppose the\\r\\nsecond melting-point is lower than the first, then obviously you've\\r\\nbeen adding an impurity to your original sample. And since something,\\r\\nthat you know definitely to be quinine, has acted as an impurity, then\\r\\nclearly the original stuff isn't quinine. On the other hand, if the\\r\\naddition of your trace of quinine to the sample doesn't lower the\\r\\nmelting-point, then your original sample is proved to be quinine also.\\r\\nThat mixing of the two stuffs and taking the melting-point is what\\r\\nthey call \\xe2\\x80\\x98taking a mixed melting-point.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Does that convey anything to\\r\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a damn, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted crudely, in a tone of despair.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould you say it all over again slowly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's hardly worth while at this stage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered,\\r\\ndismissing the subject. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll take it up again with you later on,\\r\\nperhaps, after we get the P.M. results. It was an illuminating\\r\\nconversation, though, Inspector, if my guess turns out to be right.\\r\\nNow there's another matter. Have you any idea when the morning papers\\r\\nget into the hands of the public\\xe2\\x80\\x94I mean the earliest hour that's\\r\\nlikely in the normal course?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt happens that I do know that, sir. The local delivery starts at 7\\r\\na.m. In the suburbs, it's a bit later, naturally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust make sure about it, please. Ring up the publishing departments\\r\\nof the _Courier_ and the _Gazette_. You needn't worry about the\\r\\nimported London papers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir. And now about this journal, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector added\\r\\nwith a touch of genial impishness in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvidently you won't be happy till I look at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton grumbled\\r\\nwith obvious distaste for the task. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's get it over, then, since\\r\\nyou're set on the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far as I can see, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are only\\r\\nthree threads in it that concern us: the affair he had with that girl\\r\\nHailsham; his association with Mrs. Silverdale; and his financial\\r\\naffairs\\xe2\\x80\\x94which came as a surprise to me, I must admit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton glanced up at the Inspector's words; but without replying,\\r\\nhe drew the fat volumes of the journal towards him and began his\\r\\nexamination of the passages to which Flamborough's red markers drew\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn't model his style on Pepys, evidently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said as he turned\\r\\nthe leaves rapidly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere seems to be about ten per cent. of \\xe2\\x80\\x98I's\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on\\r\\nevery page. Ah! Here's your first red marker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read the indicated passage carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the description of his feelings on getting engaged to Norma\\r\\nHailsham,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds rather superior, as if he\\r\\nfelt he'd conferred a distinct favour on her in the matter.\\r\\nApparently, even in the first flush of young love, he thought that he\\r\\nwasn't getting all that his merits deserved. I don't think Miss\\r\\nHailsham would have been flattered if she'd been able to read this at\\r\\nthe time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed rapidly over some other passages without audible comment,\\r\\nand then halted for a few moments at an entry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we come to his meeting with Mrs. Silverdale, and his first\\r\\nimpressions of her. It seems that she attracted him by her physique\\r\\nrather than by her brains. Of course, as he observes: \\xe2\\x80\\x98What single\\r\\nwoman could fully satisfy all the sides of a complex nature like\\r\\nmine?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 However, he catalogues Mrs. Silverdale's attractions lavishly\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, with a recollection of the passage in his mind, smiled\\r\\ncynically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat side of his complex nature was highly developed, I should\\r\\njudge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he affirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt runs through the stuff from start to finish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton turned over a few more pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems as though Miss Hailsham began to have some inklings of his\\r\\ntroubles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, looking up from the book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the bit where\\r\\nhe's complaining about the limitations in women's outlooks, you\\r\\nremember. Apparently he'd made his fianc\\xc3\\xa9e feel that his vision took a\\r\\nwider sweep than she imagined, and she seems to have suggested that he\\r\\nneedn't spend so much time in staring at Mrs. Silverdale. It's quite\\r\\ncharacteristic that in this entry he's suddenly discovered that the\\r\\nHailsham girl's hands fail to reach the standard of beauty which he\\r\\nthinks essential in a life-companion. He has visions of sitting in\\r\\nsuppressed irritation while these hands pour out his breakfast coffee\\r\\nevery day through all the years of marriage. It seems to worry him\\r\\nquite a lot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll find that kind of thing developing as you go on, sir. The\\r\\nplain truth is that he was tiring of the girl and he simply jotted\\r\\ndown everything he could see in her that he didn't find good enough\\r\\nfor him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton glanced over the next few entries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I see, Inspector. Now it seems her dancing isn't so good as he\\r\\nused to think it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny stick to beat a dog with,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector surmised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow they seem to have got the length of a distinct tiff, and he\\r\\nrushes at once to jot down a few bright thoughts on jealousy with a\\r\\nquotation from Mr. Wells in support of his thesis. It appears that\\r\\nthis \\xe2\\x80\\x98entanglement,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as he calls it, is cramping his individuality and\\r\\npreventing the full self-expression of his complex nature. I can't\\r\\nimagine how we got along without that word \\xe2\\x80\\x98self-expression\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when we\\r\\nwere young. It's a godsend. I trust the inventor got a medal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe next entry's rather important, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough warned him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Here we are. We come to action for a change instead of all this\\r\\nwash of talk. This is the final burst-up, eh? H'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read over the entry thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, the Hailsham girl seems to have astonished him when it came to\\r\\nthe pinch. Even deducting everything for his way of looking at things,\\r\\nshe must have been fairly furious. And Yvonne Silverdale's name seems\\r\\nto have entered pretty deeply into the discussion. \\xe2\\x80\\x98She warned me she\\r\\nknew more than I thought she did; and that she'd make me pay for what\\r\\nI was doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And again: \\xe2\\x80\\x98She said she'd stick at nothing to get even\\r\\nwith me.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It seems to have been rather a vulgar scene, altogether.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98She wasn't going to be thrown over for that woman without having her\\r\\nturn when it came.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 You know, Inspector, it sounds a bit vindictive,\\r\\neven when it's filtered through him into his journal. The woman\\r\\nscorned, and hell let loose, eh? I'm not greatly taken with the\\r\\npicture of Miss Hailsham.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bit of a virago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I was wondering when\\r\\nI read that stuff was whether she'd keep up to that standard\\r\\npermanently or whether this was just a flash in the pan. If she's the\\r\\nkind that treasures grievances. . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe might be an important piece in the jigsaw, you mean? In any case,\\r\\nI suppose we'll have to get her sized up somehow, since she plays a\\r\\npart in the story.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable turned back to the journal and skimmed over a\\r\\nnumber of the entries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out after a time, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat young fellow had an\\r\\nunpleasant mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou surprise me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector retorted ironically. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose\\r\\nyou've come to the place where he gets really smitten with Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's charms?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. There's a curious rising irritation through it all. It's evident\\r\\nthat she led him on, and then let him down, time after time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor all his fluff about his complex character and so forth, he really\\r\\nseems to have been very simple,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Flamborough's verdict. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe led\\r\\nhim a dance for months; and anyone with half an eye could see all\\r\\nalong that she was only playing with him. It's as plain as print, even\\r\\nin his own account of the business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite, I admit. But you must remember that he imagined he was out of\\r\\nthe common\\xe2\\x80\\x94irresistible. He couldn't bring himself to believe things\\r\\nwere as they were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurn to the later entries,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector advised; and Sir Clinton\\r\\ndid so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the one you mean? Where she turned him down quite bluntly, so\\r\\nthat even he got an inkling of how matters really stood?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. Now go on from there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton passed from one red marker to the other, reading the\\r\\nentries indicted at each of the points.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tune changes a bit; and his irritation seems to be on the\\r\\nup-grade. One gets the impression that he's casting round for a fresh\\r\\nmethod of getting his way and that he hasn't found one that will do?\\r\\nIs that your reading of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe talks about getting his way \\xe2\\x80\\x98by hook\\r\\nor by crook,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and one or two other phrases that come to the same\\r\\nthing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, that brings us up to a week ago. There seems to be a change in\\r\\nhis tone, now. More expectation and less exasperation, if one can put\\r\\nit that way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI read it that by that time he'd hit on his plan. He was sure of its\\r\\nsuccess, sir. Just go on to the next entry please. There's something\\r\\nthere about his triumph, as he calls it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton glanced down the page and as he did so his face lit up for\\r\\na moment as though he had seen one of his inferences confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis what you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98And only I shall know of my\\r\\ntriumph\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's it, sir. High-falutin and all that; but it points to his\\r\\nthinking he had the game in his hands. I've puzzled my brains a bit\\r\\nover what he really meant by it, though. One might read it that he\\r\\nmeant to murder the girl in the end. That would leave him as the only\\r\\nliving person who knew what had happened, you see?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not in a position to contradict that assumption,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nconfessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut so far as that goes, I think you'll find the point\\r\\ncleared up in a day or two at the rate we're going.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're very optimistic, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all the Inspector found to reply.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I've left one matter to the end, because it may have no bearing\\r\\non the case at all. The last year of that journal is full of groans\\r\\nabout his finances. He seems to have spent a good deal more than he\\r\\ncould afford, in one way and another. I've noted all the passages if\\r\\nyou want to read them, sir. They're among the set marked with white\\r\\nslips.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust give me the gist of them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom\\r\\nthat, I can see whether I want to wade through the whole thing or\\r\\nnot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's simple enough, sir. He's been borrowing money on a scale that\\r\\nwould be quite big for his resources. And I gather from some of the\\r\\nentries that he had no security that he could produce. It seems he\\r\\ndaren't go to his uncle and ask him to use his capital as security\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nmean young Hassendean's own capital which was under his uncle's\\r\\ncontrol as trustee. So he was persuaded to insure his life in favour\\r\\nof his creditor for a good round sum\\xe2\\x80\\x94figure not mentioned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo in the present circumstances the moneylender will rake in the\\r\\nwhole sum insured, after paying only a single premium?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnless the insurance company can prove suicide.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton closed the last volume of the journal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've heard of that sort of insurance racket before. And of course you\\r\\nremember that shooting affair in Scotland thirty years ago when the\\r\\nprosecution made a strong point out of just this very type of\\r\\ntransaction. Have you had time to make any inquiries along that line\\r\\nyet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough was evidently glad to get the opportunity of showing his\\r\\nefficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI took it up at once, sir. In one entry, he mentioned the name of the\\r\\ncompany: the Western Medical and Mercantile Assurance Co. I put a\\r\\ntrunk call through to their head office and got the particulars of the\\r\\npolicy. It's for \\xc2\\xa35,000 and it's in favour of Dudley Amyas Guisborough\\r\\n& Co.\\xe2\\x80\\x94the moneylender.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSounds very aristocratic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable commented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, that's only his trade sign. His real name's Spratton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo claim been made yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. I don't suppose he's hurrying. The inquest was adjourned,\\r\\nyou remember; and until they bring in some verdict excluding suicide,\\r\\nSpratton can't do much. There's a suicide clause in the policy, I\\r\\nlearned. But if it pans out as a murder, then Spratton's \\xc2\\xa35,000 in\\r\\npocket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn fact, Inspector, Mr. Justice is doing a very good bit of work for\\r\\nDudley Amyas Guisborough & Co.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough seemed struck by an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll go and pay a call on Mr. Spratton, I think. I'll do it now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, he's a local light, is he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. He was mixed up in a case last year. You won't remember it,\\r\\nthough. It never came to much. Just an old man who fell into\\r\\nSpratton's hands and was driven to suicide by the damnable rapacity of\\r\\nthat shark. Inspector Ferryside had to look into the matter, and I\\r\\nremember talking over the case with him. That's how it sticks in my\\r\\nmemory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, see what you can make of him, Inspector. But I shan't be\\r\\ndisappointed if you come back empty-handed. Even if he were mixed up\\r\\nin this affair, he'll have taken good care not to leave a straight\\r\\nstring leading back to his front door. If it was a case of murder for\\r\\nprofit, you know, there would be plenty of time to draw up a pretty\\r\\ngood scheme beforehand. It wouldn't be done on the spur of the\\r\\nmoment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Creditor\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough's orderly mind found something to respect in the\\r\\nbusinesslike appearance of the moneylender's premises. As he waited at\\r\\nthe counter of the outer office while his card was submitted to the\\r\\nprincipal, he was struck by the spick-and-span appearance of the\\r\\nfittings and the industry of the small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite impressive as a fly-trap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ruminated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooks like a good\\r\\nsolid business with plenty of money to spend. And the clerks have good\\r\\nmanners, too. Spratton's evidently bent on making a nice impression on\\r\\nnew clients.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not kept waiting more than a minute before the clerk returned\\r\\nand ushered him into a room which had very little of the office in its\\r\\nfurnishings. As he entered, a clean-shaven man in the late thirties\\r\\nrose from an arm-chair beside the fire. At the first glance, his\\r\\nappearance seemed to strike some chord in the Inspector's memory; and\\r\\nFlamborough found himself pursuing an elusive recollection which he\\r\\nfailed to run to ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moneylender seemed to regard the Inspector's visit as a perfectly\\r\\nnormal event. His manner was genial without being effusive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome in, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he invited, with a gesture towards one of the\\r\\ncomfortable chairs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry a cigarette?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe proffered a large silver box, but Flamborough declined to smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what can I do for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spratton inquired pleasantly, replacing\\r\\nthe box on the mantelpiece. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoney's very tight these days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not a client,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough informed him, with a slightly sardonic\\r\\nsmile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry to disappoint you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moneylender's eyes narrowed, but otherwise he showed no outward\\r\\nsign of his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I'm rather at a loss to know what you want,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed,\\r\\nwithout any lapse from his initial geniality. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI run my business\\r\\nstrictly within the four corners of the Act. You've no complaint about\\r\\nthat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector had no intention of wasting time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's this affair of young Hassendean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe young\\r\\nfellow who was murdered the other day. You must have seen the case in\\r\\nthe papers. I understand he was a client of yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA flash of intelligence passed over the moneylender's face, but he\\r\\nsuppressed it almost instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHassendean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he repeated, as though cudgelling his memory. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've some\\r\\nrecollection of the name. But my business is a large one, and I don't\\r\\nprofess to carry all the details in my head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped over to the bell and rang it. When a clerk appeared in\\r\\nanswer to the summons, the moneylender turned to give an order:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we had some transactions with a Mr. Hassendean\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Ronald\\r\\nHassendean, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he glanced at Flamborough for confirmation, and\\r\\nthen continued: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust bring me that file, Plowden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did not take the Inspector long to make up his mind that this\\r\\nby-play was intended merely to give Spratton time to find his\\r\\nbearings; but Flamborough waited patiently until the clerk returned\\r\\nand placed a filing-case on the table. Spratton turned over the leaves\\r\\nfor a few moments, as though refreshing his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis fellow would have made a good actor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough reflected with\\r\\na certain admiration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe does it deuced well. But who the devil does\\r\\nhe remind me of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpratton's nicely-calculated interlude came to an end, and he turned\\r\\nback to the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're quite right. I find that he had some transactions with us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey began about eleven months ago, didn't they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moneylender nodded in confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI find that I lent him \\xc2\\xa3100 first of all. Two months after that\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nnot having repaid anything\\xe2\\x80\\x94I lent him \\xc2\\xa3200. Then there was a further\\r\\nitem of \\xc2\\xa3300 in April, part of which he seems to have paid back to me\\r\\nlater on in order to square up for the interest which he hadn't paid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat security had you for these loans?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the moneylender's eyes narrowed for a moment; but his manner\\r\\nbetrayed nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp to that time, I was quite satisfied with his prospects.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd after that he borrowed more from you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cApparently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spratton made a pretence of consulting the file. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\ncame to me in June for another \\xc2\\xa3500, and of course the interest was\\r\\nmounting up gradually.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must have been making the money fly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough suggested with a\\r\\ncertain indifference. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I could see my way to splash dibs at\\r\\nthat rate. It would be a new experience. But when it came to figures\\r\\nof that size, I suppose you expected something better in the way of\\r\\nsecurity?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the Inspector's casual tone, the moneylender seemed to suspect\\r\\na trap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, by that time he was in my books for well over a thousand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appeared to feel that frankness would be best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI arranged matters for him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe took out a policy on\\r\\nhis life with the Western Medical and Mercantile. I have the policy in\\r\\nmy safe if you wish to see it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course you allowed a reasonable margin for contingencies, I\\r\\nsuppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough inquired sympathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, naturally I expected him to go on borrowing, so I had to allow a\\r\\nfair margin for contingencies. The policy was for \\xc2\\xa35,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you're about \\xc2\\xa34,000 in pocket, now that he's dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\ncommented enviously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome people are lucky.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgainst that you've got to offset the bad debts I make,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spratton\\r\\npointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough could not pretend to himself that he had managed to elicit\\r\\nmuch of importance during his call; but he had no excuse for\\r\\nprolonging the interview. He rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't suppose we shall need any of these facts if it comes to\\r\\ntrying anyone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as he prepared to leave. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we do, you'll\\r\\nhave plenty of warning, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moneylender opened a door which allowed a direct exit into the\\r\\ncorridor, and Flamborough went out. As he walked along the passage, he\\r\\nwas still racking his memory to discover who Spratton resembled; and\\r\\nat last, as he reached the pavement outside, it flashed into his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course! It's the Chief! Put a moustache on to that fellow and dye\\r\\nhis hair a bit and he might pass for Driffield in the dusk. He's not a\\r\\ntwin-brother; but there's a resemblance of sorts, undoubtedly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned to headquarters feeling that he had wasted his time over\\r\\nthe moneylender. Except that he had now seen the man in the flesh and\\r\\nhad an opportunity of sizing him up, he was really no further forward\\r\\nthan he had been before; for the few actual figures of transactions\\r\\nwhich he had obtained were obviously of little interest in themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he entered the police station, a constable came forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's a gentleman here, Inspector Flamborough. He's called about\\r\\nthe Silverdale case and he wants to see you. He's a foreigner of the\\r\\nname of Renard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. Send him along to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few moments, the constable ushered in a small man with a black\\r\\nmoustache and a shock of stiffly-brushed hair which gave him a foreign\\r\\nappearance. The Inspector was relieved to find that he spoke perfect\\r\\nEnglish, though with a slight accent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy name is Octave Renard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he introduced himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the brother\\r\\nof Mrs. Yvonne Silverdale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, with a certain admiration for the fortitude of the little\\r\\nman in the tragic circumstances, made haste to put him at his ease by\\r\\nexpressing his sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very sad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the little Frenchman, with an obvious effort to\\r\\nkeep himself under control. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very fond of my sister, you\\r\\nunderstand. She was so gay, so fond of life. She enjoyed herself every\\r\\nmoment of the day. And now\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA gesture filled out the missing phrase.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face betrayed his commiseration; but he was a busy man,\\r\\nand could ill afford to waste time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wished to see me about something?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll I know is what was printed in the newspapers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard explained.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to learn the truth of the case\\xe2\\x80\\x94the real facts. And you\\r\\nare in charge of the case, I was told. So I come to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, after a moment's hesitation, gave him an outline of the\\r\\nbungalow tragedy, softening some of the details and omitting anything\\r\\nwhich he thought it undesirable to make public. Renard listened, with\\r\\nan occasional nervous twitch which showed that his imagination was at\\r\\nwork, clothing the bare bones of the Inspector's narrative with flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a bad business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, shaking his head mournfully as\\r\\nFlamborough concluded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo think that such a thing should have\\r\\nhappened just when she had had her great stroke of good-fortune! It is\\r\\nincredible, the irony of Fate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector pricked up his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe'd had a piece of good luck, lately, you say, Mr. Renard? What was\\r\\nthat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do not know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the little man inquired in surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut surely\\r\\nher husband must have told you? No?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is strange,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not quite understand that.\\r\\nMy sister was the favourite of her aunt. She was down in her will, you\\r\\nunderstand? And my aunt was a very wealthy woman. Pots of money, as\\r\\nyou English say. For some time my aunt has been in feeble health. She\\r\\nhas been going downhill for the last year or more. A heart trouble,\\r\\nyou understand. And just a fortnight ago, puff!\\xe2\\x80\\x94she went out like\\r\\nthat. Like a blown-out candle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector prompted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer will was in the keeping of her lawyer and he communicated the\\r\\ncontents to myself and my sister. We were trustees, you see. I had a\\r\\nlittle bequest to myself; but the principal sum went to my sister. I\\r\\nwas surprised; I had not thought that my aunt had so much money\\xe2\\x80\\x94mostly\\r\\nin American stocks and shares. In your English money it came to about\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa312,000. In francs, of course, it is colossal\\xe2\\x80\\x94a million and a half at\\r\\nleast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interjected Flamborough, now keenly interested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your sister\\r\\nknew of this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe learned it from me just two days before her death. And you\\r\\nunderstand, there was no grief with it. My aunt had suffered terribly\\r\\nin the last few months. Angina pectoris, very painful. We were quite\\r\\nglad to see her suffering at an end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough felt that this fresh piece of information needed\\r\\nconsideration before he ventured on to the ground which had been\\r\\ndisclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you staying in Westerhaven, Mr. Renard?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, for a few days yet, I expect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the little man answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nsome legal matters in my hands which need my presence on the spot. As\\r\\nmy sister is now dead, there is the disposal of this money to be\\r\\nconsidered. I find difficulties which I had not expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your address during your stay will be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am at the Imperial Hotel. You can always find me there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Renard, I'd like to have a talk with you later on, if I\\r\\nmay. Just at present, I'm very busy. Perhaps you could spare a few\\r\\nminutes when my hands are free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be delighted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard acquiesced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhenever you wish to see\\r\\nme, send a message. I am much worried, you understand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he concluded,\\r\\nwith a quiver in his voice which pierced through the official coating\\r\\nof Flamborough and touched the softer material inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter X\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Received\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next day or two, Sir Clinton's interest in the Hassendean case\\r\\nappeared to have faded out; and Inspector Flamborough, after following\\r\\nup one or two clues which eventually proved useless, was beginning to\\r\\nfeel perturbed by the lack of direct progress which the investigation\\r\\nshowed. Rather to his relief, one morning the Chief Constable summoned\\r\\nhim to his office. Flamborough began a somewhat apologetic account of\\r\\nhis fruitless investigations; but Sir Clinton cut him short with a\\r\\nword or two of appreciation of his zeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's something more definite for you to go on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've\\r\\njust had a preliminary report from the London man whom we put on to\\r\\nsearch for the poison. I asked him to let me have a private opinion at\\r\\nthe earliest possible moment. His official report will come in later,\\r\\nof course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas he spotted it, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector inquired eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's reached the same conclusion as I did\\xe2\\x80\\x94and as I suppose you did\\r\\nalso,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton assured him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough looked puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't spot it myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed diffidently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn fact, I don't\\r\\nsee how there was anything to show definitely what stuff it was,\\r\\nbarring dilatation of the eye-pupils, and that might have been due to\\r\\nvarious drugs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou should never lose an opportunity of exercising your powers of\\r\\ninference, Inspector. I mustn't rob you of this one. Now put together\\r\\ntwo things: the episode of the mixed melting-point and the phrase\\r\\nabout his \\xe2\\x80\\x98triumph\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that young Hassendean wrote in his journal. Add\\r\\nthe state of the girl's pupils as a third point\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there you are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough pondered for a while over this assortment of information,\\r\\nbut finally shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't see it yet, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton declared, with the air of one bestowing\\r\\nbenevolence, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we'd better let it dawn on you slowly. You might\\r\\nbe angry with yourself if you realised all of a sudden how simple it\\r\\nis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose to his feet as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we'll pay a visit to the Croft-Thornton Institute now, and\\r\\nsee how Markfield has been getting along with his examination. We may\\r\\nas well have a check, before we begin to speculate too freely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Markfield in his laboratory, and Sir Clinton came to\\r\\nbusiness at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe came over to see how you were getting on with that poison\\r\\nbusiness, Dr. Markfield. Can you give us any news?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield indicated a notebook on his desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've got it out, I think. It's all there; but I haven't had time to\\r\\nwrite a proper report on it yet. It was\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHyoscine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield stared at him with evident appreciation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're quite right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confirmed, with some surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose\\r\\nyou've got private information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable evaded the point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm asking this question only for our own information; you won't be\\r\\nasked to swear to it in court. What amount of hyoscine do you think\\r\\nwas in the body, altogether? I mean, judging from the results you\\r\\nobtained yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield considered for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm giving you a guess, but I think it's fairly near the mark. I\\r\\nwouldn't, of course, take my oath on it. But the very smallest\\r\\nquantity, judging from my results, would be somewhere in the\\r\\nneighbourhood of seven or eight milligrammes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you looked up anything about the stuff\\xe2\\x80\\x94maximum dose, and so\\r\\nforth?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe maximum dose of hyoscine hydrobromide is down in the books as\\r\\nsix-tenths of a milligramme\\xe2\\x80\\x94about a hundredth of a grain in\\r\\napothecaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 weights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen she must have swallowed ten or twelve times the maximum dose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nSir Clinton calculated, after a moment or two of mental arithmetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused for a space, then turned again to Markfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd like to see the hyoscine in your store here, if you can lay your\\r\\nhands on it easily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield made no objection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you'd come in yesterday, the bottle would have been here, beside\\r\\nme. I've taken it back to the shelf now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you borrowed it to do a mixed melting-point?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. When there's only a trace of a stuff to identify, it's the\\r\\neasiest method. But you seem to know something about chemistry?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout enough to make mistakes with, I'm afraid. It simply happened\\r\\nthat someone described the mixed melting-point business to me once;\\r\\nand it stuck in my mind. Now suppose we look at this store of yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield led them along a passage and threw open a door at the end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don't keep it locked?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired casually, as he\\r\\npassed in, followed by the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield answered in some surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's the general chemical\\r\\nstore for this department. There's no point in keeping it locked. All\\r\\nour stuffs are here, and it would be a devilish nuisance if one had to\\r\\nfish out a key every time one wanted some chloroform or benzene. We\\r\\nkeep the duty-free alcohol locked up, of course. That's necessary\\r\\nunder the Customs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton readily agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're all trustworthy people, naturally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not\\r\\nlike a place where you have junior students about who might play\\r\\nthoughtless tricks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield went over to one of the cases which lined the room, searched\\r\\nalong a shelf, and took down a tiny bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's the stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained, holding it out to the Chief\\r\\nConstable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's the hydrobromide, of course\\xe2\\x80\\x94a salt of the alkaloid\\r\\nitself. This is the compound that's used in medicine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that he had got it, Sir Clinton seemed to have little interest in\\r\\nthe substance. He handed it across to Flamborough who, after looking\\r\\nat it with would-be sagacity, returned it to Markfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's just one other point that occurs to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable\\r\\nexplained, as Markfield returned the poison-bottle to its original\\r\\nplace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you, by any chance, got an old notebook belonging to\\r\\nyoung Hassendean on the premises? Anything of the sort would do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector could make nothing of this demand and his face betrayed\\r\\nhis perplexity as he considered it. Markfield thought for a few\\r\\nmoments before replying, evidently trying to recall the existence of\\r\\nany article which would suit Sir Clinton's purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I've got a rough notebook of his somewhere in my room,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it's only a record of weighings and things like\\r\\nthat. Would it do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe very thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton declared, gratefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd be much\\r\\nobliged if you could lay your hands on it for me now. I hope it isn't\\r\\ntroubling you too much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident from Markfield's expression that he was as much puzzled\\r\\nas the Inspector; and his curiosity seemed to quicken his steps on the\\r\\nway back to his room. After a few minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hunting, he unearthed the\\r\\nnotebook of which he was in search and laid it on the table before Sir\\r\\nClinton. Flamborough, familiar with young Hassendean's writing, had no\\r\\ndifficulty in seeing that the notes were in the dead man's hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton turned over the leaves idly, examining an entry here and\\r\\nthere. The last one seemed to satisfy him, and he put an end to his\\r\\ninspection. Flamborough bent over the table and was mystified to find\\r\\nonly the following entry on the exposed leaf:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Weight of potash bulb       = 50.7789 grs.\\r\\n  Weight of potash bulb + CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 = 50.9825 grs.\\r\\n                              \\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\r\\n  Weight of CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82               = 0.2046  grs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Clinton casually, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you happen to have one of\\r\\nyour own notebooks at hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94something with the same sort of thing in\\r\\nthem?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield, obviously puzzled, went over to a drawer and pulled out a\\r\\nnotebook which he passed to the Chief Constable. Again Sir Clinton\\r\\nskimmed over the pages, apparently at random, and then left the second\\r\\nbook open beside the first one. Flamborough, determined to miss\\r\\nnothing, examined the exposed page in Markfield's notebook, and was\\r\\nrewarded by this:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n  Weight of U-tube       = 24.7792 gms.\\r\\n  Weight of U-tube + H\\xe2\\x82\\x82O = 24.9047 gms.\\r\\n                         \\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\r\\n  Weight of H\\xe2\\x82\\x82O          = 0.1255  gms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDamned if I see what he's driving at,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector said savagely to\\r\\nhimself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's Greek to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA careless young fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable pronounced acidly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\neye caught three blunders in plain arithmetic as I glanced through\\r\\nthese notes. There's one on this page here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he indicated the open\\r\\nbook. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe seems to have been a very slapdash sort of person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn unreliable young hound!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Markfield's slightly intensified\\r\\ndescription. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was pure influence that kept him here for more than a\\r\\nweek. Old Thornton, who put up most of the money for building this\\r\\nplace, was interested in him\\xe2\\x80\\x94knew his father, I think\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so we had to\\r\\nkeep the young pup here for fear of rasping old Thornton's feelings.\\r\\nOtherwise. . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gesture accompanying the aposiopesis expressed Markfield's idea of\\r\\nthe fate which would at once have befallen young Hassendean had his\\r\\nprotector's influence been withdrawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable appeared enlightened by this fresh information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI couldn't imagine how you came to let him have the run of the place\\r\\nfor so long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, of course, as things were, it was\\r\\nevidently cheaper to keep him, even if he did no useful work. One\\r\\ncan't afford to alienate one's benefactors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pause, he continued, reverting apparently to an earlier line\\r\\nof thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's see. You made out that something like twelve times the normal\\r\\ndose of hyoscine had been administered?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield nodded his assent, but qualified it in words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a rough figure, remember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of fact, the multiple I\\r\\nhad in my mind was 15. I suppose it's quite possible that some of the\\r\\nstuff escaped you and that your figure is an under-estimate?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite likely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield admitted frankly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave you the lowest\\r\\nfigure, naturally\\xe2\\x80\\x94a figure I could swear to if it came to the point.\\r\\nAs it's a legal case, it's safer to be under than over the mark. But\\r\\nquite probably, as you say, I didn't manage to isolate all the stuff\\r\\nthat was really present; and I wouldn't deny that the quantity in the\\r\\nbody may have run up to ten milligrammes or even slightly over it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it's perhaps hardly worth bothering about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable\\r\\nconcluded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe main thing is that even at the lowest estimate she\\r\\nmust have swallowed enough of the poison to kill her in a reasonably\\r\\nshort time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this he seemed satisfied, and after a few questions about the\\r\\npreparation and submission of Markfield's official report, he took his\\r\\nleave. As he turned away, however, a fresh thought seemed to strike\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, Dr. Markfield, do you know if Miss Hailsham's here this\\r\\nmorning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw her as I came in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd like to have a few words with her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOfficially?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're not going to worry the girl,\\r\\nare you? If it's anything I can tell you about, I'd be only too glad,\\r\\nyou know. It's not very nice for a girl to have the tale going round\\r\\nthat she's been hauled in by the police in a murder case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable conceded the point without ado.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen perhaps you could send for her and we could speak to her in\\r\\nhere. It would be more private, and there need be no talk about it\\r\\noutside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield acquiesced at once. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that would be\\r\\nbetter. I'll send for her now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rang a bell and despatched a boy with a message. In a few minutes a\\r\\ntap on the door sounded, and Markfield ushered Norma Hailsham into the\\r\\nroom. Inspector Flamborough glanced at her with interest, to see how\\r\\nfar his conception of her personality agreed with the reality. She was\\r\\na girl apparently between twenty and twenty-five, dressed with\\r\\nscrupulous neatness. Quite obviously, she spent money freely on her\\r\\nclothes and knew how to get value for what she spent. But as his eyes\\r\\ntravelled up to her face, the Inspector received a more vivid\\r\\nimpression. Her features were striking rather than handsome, and\\r\\nFlamborough noted especially the squarish chin and the long\\r\\nthin-lipped flexible mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe might flash up in a moment, but\\r\\nwith that jaw and those lips she wouldn't cool down again in a hurry.\\r\\nI was right when I put her down as a vindictive type. Shouldn't much\\r\\ncare to have trouble with her myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at Sir Clinton for tacit instructions, but apparently the\\r\\nChief Constable proposed to take charge of the interview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you sit down, Miss Hailsham,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested, drawing\\r\\nforward a chair for the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough noticed with professional interest that by his apparently\\r\\ncasual courtesy, the Chief Constable had unobtrusively man\\xc5\\x93uvred the\\r\\ngirl into a position in which her face was clearly illuminated by the\\r\\nlight from the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Inspector Flamborough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton went on, with a gesture\\r\\nof introduction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should like to ask you one or two questions about\\r\\nan awkward case we have in our hands\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Hassendean business. I'm\\r\\nafraid it will be painful for you; but I'm sure you'll give us what\\r\\nhelp you can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNorma Hailsham's thin lips set in a hard line at his first words, but\\r\\nthe movement was apparently involuntary, for she relaxed them again as\\r\\nSir Clinton finished his remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be quite glad to give any help I can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in a level\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, studying her expression, noticed a swift shift of her\\r\\nglance from one to the other of the three men before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's a bit over-selfconscious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he judged privately. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she's the\\r\\nregular look-monger type, anyhow; and quite likely she makes play with\\r\\nher eyes when she's talking to any man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed to be making a merit of frankness:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really haven't any definite questions I want to ask you, Miss\\r\\nHailsham,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we hoped was that you might have\\r\\nsomething to tell us which indirectly might throw some light on this\\r\\naffair. You see, we come into it without knowing anything about the\\r\\npeople involved, and naturally any trifle may help us. Now if I'm not\\r\\nmistaken, you knew Mr. Hassendean fairly well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was engaged to him at one time. He broke off the engagement for\\r\\nvarious reasons. That's common knowledge, I believe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould you give us any of the reasons? I don't wish to pry, you\\r\\nunderstand; but I think it's an important point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hailsham's face showed that he had touched a sore place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe threw me over for another woman\\xe2\\x80\\x94brutally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that creature.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Now I'd like to put a blunt question. Was your engagement, while\\r\\nit lasted, a happy one? I mean, of course, before he was attracted to\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNorma Hailsham sat with knitted brows for a few moments before\\r\\nanswering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's difficult to answer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she pointed out at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must confess\\r\\nthat I always felt he was thinking more of himself than of me, and it\\r\\nwas a disappointment. But, you see, I was very keen on him; and that\\r\\nmade a difference, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat led to the breaking of your engagement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean what led up to it? Well, we were having continual friction\\r\\nover Yvonne Silverdale. He was neglecting me and spending his time\\r\\nwith her. Naturally, I spoke to him about it more than once. I wasn't\\r\\ngoing to be slighted on account of that woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no mistaking the under-current of animosity in the girl's\\r\\nvoice in the last sentence. Sir Clinton ignored it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat were your ideas about the relations between Mr. Hassendean and\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hailsham's thin lips curled in undisguised contempt as she heard\\r\\nthe question. She made a gesture as though averting herself from\\r\\nsomething distasteful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's hardly necessary to enter into _that_, is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can judge for yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though she verbally evaded the point, the tone in which she spoke\\r\\nwas sufficient to betray her private views on the subject. Then with\\r\\nintense bitterness mingled with a certain malicious joy, she added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe got what she deserved in the end. I don't pretend I'm sorry. I\\r\\nthink they were both well served.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her temper, which hitherto she had kept under control, broke from\\r\\nrestraint:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't care who knows it! They deserved all they got, both of them.\\r\\nWhat business had she\\xe2\\x80\\x94with a husband of her own\\xe2\\x80\\x94to come and lure him\\r\\naway? She made him break off his engagement to me simply to gratify\\r\\nher own vanity. You don't expect me to shed tears over them after\\r\\nthat? One can forgive a good deal, but there's no use making a\\r\\npretence in things like that. She hit me as hard as she could, and I'm\\r\\nglad she's got her deserts. I warned him at the time that he wouldn't\\r\\ncome off so well as he thought; and he laughed in my face when I said\\r\\nit. Well, it's my turn to laugh. The account's even.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she actually did laugh, with a catch of hysteria in the laughter.\\r\\nIt needed no great skill in psychology to see that wounded pride\\r\\nshared with disappointed passion in causing this outbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton checked the hysteria before it gained complete hold over\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm afraid you haven't told us anything that was new to us, Miss\\r\\nHailsham,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, frigidly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis melodramatic business gets us no\\r\\nfurther forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked at him with hard eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat help do you expect from me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not anxious to\\r\\nsee him avenged\\xe2\\x80\\x94far from it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton evidently realised that nothing was to be gained by\\r\\npursuing that line of inquiry. Whether the girl had any suspicions or\\r\\nnot, she certainly did not intend to supply information which might\\r\\nlead to the capture of the murderer. The Chief Constable waited until\\r\\nshe had become calmer before putting his next question:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you happen to know anything about an alkaloid called hyoscine,\\r\\nMiss Hailsham?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHyoscine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Avice Deepcar's working on it just\\r\\nnow. She's been at it for some time under Dr. Silverdale's direction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, glancing surreptitiously at Markfield, noted an angry\\r\\nstart which the chemist apparently could not suppress. Put on the\\r\\nalert by this, the Inspector reflected that Markfield himself must\\r\\nhave had this piece of information, and had refrained from\\r\\nvolunteering it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI meant as regards its properties,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton interposed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not\\r\\nan expert in these things like you chemical people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not an alkaloid expert,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss Hailsham objected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll I can\\r\\nremember about it is that it's used in Twilight Sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe it is, now that you mention it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton agreed,\\r\\npolitely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, have you a car, Miss Hailsham?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. A Morris-Oxford four-seater.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA saloon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, a touring model. Why do you ask?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone's been asking for information about a car which seems to have\\r\\nknocked a man over on the night of the last fog. You weren't out that\\r\\nnight, I suppose, Miss Hailsham?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was, as it happened. I went out to a dance. But I'd a sore throat;\\r\\nand the fog made it worse; so I came away very early and got home as\\r\\nbest I could. But it wasn't my car that knocked anyone down. I never\\r\\nhad an accident in my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might have been excused in that fog, I think, even if you had a\\r\\ncollision. But evidently it's not your car we're after. What was the\\r\\nnumber of the car we heard about, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough consulted his notebook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGX.9074, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay that again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield demanded, pricking up his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGX.9074 was the number.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's the number of my car,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield volunteered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought for some time, apparently trying to retrace his experiences\\r\\nin the fog. At last his face lighted up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I guess I know what it is. When I was piloting Dr. Ringwood that\\r\\nnight, a fellow nearly walked straight into my front mudguard. I may\\r\\nhave hurt his feelings by what I said about his brains, but I swear I\\r\\ndidn't touch him with the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot our affair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton hastened to assure him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a matter\\r\\nfor your insurance company if anything comes of it. And I gathered\\r\\nfrom Dr. Ringwood that you didn't exactly break records in your trip\\r\\nacross town, so I doubt if you need worry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shan't,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Markfield, crossly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can refer him to me if he\\r\\ncomes to you again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'd nothing to do with the matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was\\r\\ntold he'd get the owner's address from the County Council. I expect he\\r\\ngot into a calmer frame of mind when he'd had time to think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to Miss Hailsham, who seemed to have recovered complete\\r\\ncontrol over herself during this interlude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that's all we need worry you with, Miss Hailsham. I'm sorry\\r\\nthat we put you to so much trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a sign that the interview was at an end, he moved over to open the\\r\\ndoor for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly don't wish you success,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said icily, as she left the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I think that's all we have to do here, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nsaid as he turned back from the open door. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe mustn't take up any\\r\\nmore of Dr. Markfield's time. I don't want to hurry you too much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded to Markfield, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you'll let us have your official report as\\r\\nsoon as you can, won't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield promised with a nod, and the two officials left the\\r\\nbuilding. When they reached headquarters again, Sir Clinton led the\\r\\nway to his own office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down for a moment or two, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he invited. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may as\\r\\nwell glance over the London man's report when you're about it. Here it\\r\\nis\\xe2\\x80\\x94not for actual use, of course, until we get the official version\\r\\nfrom him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed over a paper which Flamborough unfolded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector inquired before beginning to read,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cis there any reason for keeping back this information? These infernal\\r\\nreporters are all over me for details; and if this poison affair could\\r\\nbe published without doing any harm, I might as well dole it out to\\r\\nthem to keep them quiet. They haven't had much from me in the last\\r\\ntwenty-four hours, and it's better to give them what we can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed to attach some importance to this matter, for he\\r\\nconsidered it for a few seconds before replying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them have the name of the stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he directed at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't\\r\\nthink I'd supply them with any details, though. I'm quite satisfied\\r\\nabout the name of the drug, but the dose is still more or less a\\r\\nmatter of opinion, and we'd better not say anything about that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough glanced up from the report in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarkfield and the London man both seem to put the dose round about\\r\\nthe same figure\\xe2\\x80\\x94eight milligrammes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth of them must be super-sharp workers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pointed out.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't profess to be a chemist, Inspector, but I know enough about\\r\\nthings to realise that they've done a bit of a feat there. However,\\r\\nlet's get on to something more immediately interesting. What did you\\r\\nmake of the Hailsham girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did I make of her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough repeated, in order to gain a\\r\\nlittle time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought she was more or less what I'd expected her to\\r\\nbe, sir. A hard vixen with a good opinion of herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and simply mad\\r\\nwith rage at being jilted: that's what I made of her. Revengeful, too.\\r\\nAnd a bit vulgar, sir. No decent girl would talk like that about a\\r\\ndead man to a set of strangers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe hadn't much to tell us that was useful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said,\\r\\nkeeping to the main point. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I quite agree with you as to the\\r\\ngeneral tone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough turned to a matter which had puzzled him during their\\r\\nvisit to the Institute:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did you want young Hassendean's notebook for, sir? I didn't\\r\\nquite make that out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, you saw what I got out of it: arithmetical errors which proved\\r\\nconclusively that he was a careless worker who didn't take any trouble\\r\\nat all to verify his results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a kind of notion that you got more out of it than that, sir, or\\r\\nyou wouldn't have asked to see Markfield's notebook as well. It\\r\\ndoesn't take someone else's notebook to spot slips in a man's\\r\\narithmetic, surely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton gazed blandly at his subordinate:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow that you've got that length, it would be a pity to spoil your\\r\\npleasure in the rest of the inference. Just think it out and tell me\\r\\nthe result, to see if we both reach the same conclusion independently.\\r\\nYou'll find a weights-and-measures conversion table useful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConversion table, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the Inspector, evidently quite at sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. \\xe2\\x80\\x98One metre equals 39\\xc2\\xb737 inches,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and all that sort of thing. The\\r\\nsort of stuff one used at school, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo deep for me, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector acknowledged ruefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll\\r\\nneed to tell me the answer. And that reminds me, what made you ask\\r\\nwhether the dose could have been fifteen times the maximum?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable was just about to take pity on his subordinate\\r\\nwhen the desk-telephone rang sharply. Sir Clinton picked up the\\r\\nreceiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c. . . Yes. Inspector Flamborough is here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed the receiver across to the Inspector, who conducted a\\r\\ndisjointed conversation with the person at the other end of the wire.\\r\\nAt length Flamborough put down the instrument and turned to Sir\\r\\nClinton with an expression of satisfaction on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe're on to something, sir. That was Fossaway ringing up from\\r\\nFountain Street. It seems a man called there a few minutes ago and\\r\\nbegan fishing round to know if there was any likelihood of a reward\\r\\nbeing offered in connection with the bungalow case. He seemed as if he\\r\\nmight know something, and they handed him over to Detective-Sergeant\\r\\nFossaway to see what he could make of him. Fossaway's fairly satisfied\\r\\nthat there's something behind it, though he could extract nothing\\r\\nwhatever from the fellow in the way of definite statements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas Fossaway got him there still?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. He'd no power to detain him, of course; and the fellow\\r\\nturned stubborn in the end and went off without saying anything\\r\\ndefinite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope they haven't lost him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sir. They know him quite well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of person is he, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA nasty type, sir. He keeps one of these little low-down shops where\\r\\nyou can buy a lot of queer things. Once we nearly had him over the\\r\\nsale of some postcards, but he was too clever for us at the last\\r\\nmoment. Then he was up in an assault case: he'd been wandering round\\r\\nthe Park after dark, disturbing couples with a flash-lamp. A\\r\\nthoroughly low-down little creature. His name's Whalley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face showed very plainly his view of the activities of\\r\\nMr. Whalley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, so long as they can lay their hands on him any time we need\\r\\nhim, it's all right. I think we'll persuade him to talk. By the way,\\r\\nwas this lamp-flashing stunt of his done for \\xc3\\xa6sthetic enjoyment, or\\r\\nwas he doing a bit of blackmailing on the quiet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, nobody actually lodged a complaint against him; but there's no\\r\\nsaying whether people paid him or not. His record doesn't make it\\r\\nimprobable that he might do something in that line, if he could manage\\r\\nto pull it off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I'll leave Mr. Whalley to your care, Inspector. He sounds\\r\\ninteresting, if you can induce him to squeak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Code Advertisement\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following morning, Inspector Flamborough was summoned to the\\r\\nChief Constable's room and, on his arrival, was somewhat surprised to\\r\\nfind his superior poring over a copy of the _Westerhaven Courier_. It\\r\\nwas not Sir Clinton's habit to read newspapers during office hours;\\r\\nand the Inspector's eyebrows lifted slightly at the unwonted\\r\\nspectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's a little puzzle for you, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton greeted him\\r\\nas he came in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust have a look at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe folded the newspaper to a convenient size and handed it over,\\r\\npointing as he did so to an advertisement to which attention had been\\r\\ndrawn by a couple of crosses in pen and ink. Flamborough took the\\r\\npaper and scanned the advertisement:\\r\\n\\r\\n  DRIFFIELD. AAACC. CCCDE. EEEEF.\\r\\n  HHHHH. IIIIJ. NNNNO. OOOOO.\\r\\n  RRSSS. SSTTT. TTTTT. TTUUW. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn't seem exactly lucid, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confessed, as he read it a\\r\\nsecond time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of letters in alphabetical order and divided into\\r\\ngroups of five\\xe2\\x80\\x94bar the single letter at the end. I suppose it was your\\r\\nname at the front that attracted your eye?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis copy of the paper came to me through\\r\\nthe post, marked as you see it. It came in by the second delivery.\\r\\nHere's the wrapper. It'll probably suggest something to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough looked at it carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrdinary official stamped wrapper. There's no clue there, since you\\r\\ncan buy 'em by the hundred anywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a glance at the address enlightened him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSame old game, sir? Letters clipped from telegraph forms and gummed\\r\\non to the wrapper. It looks like Mr. Justice again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe chances are in favour of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton agreed, with a faint\\r\\ntinge of mockery in his voice at the Inspector's eager recognition of\\r\\nthe obvious. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, what about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough scanned the advertisement once more, but no sign of\\r\\ncomprehension lightened his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's clear up one point before we tackle the lettering,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nsuggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's to-day's issue of the _Courier_; so this\\r\\nadvertisement was received at the newspaper office yesterday. Since\\r\\nthe thing reached me by the second post, this copy of the paper may\\r\\nhave been bought in the normal way\\xe2\\x80\\x94first thing in the morning\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nposted at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's sound, sir. It's among the ordinary advertisements\\xe2\\x80\\x94not in the\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Too Late For Classification\\xe2\\x80\\x99 section.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may be a hoax, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton mused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the\\r\\ntelegram-form business would hardly occur to a practical joker. I\\r\\nthink one can take it as a genuine contribution until it's proved to\\r\\nbe a fake. Now what do you make of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyphers are not my long suit, sir. Frankly, it seems to me just a\\r\\njumble, and I don't think I'd make it anything else if I tried.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton reflected for a minute or two in silence, his eyes fixed\\r\\non the advertisement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've a notion that this is only Chapter I, Inspector. There's more to\\r\\ncome, in all probability. If it's Mr. Justice, he's not the man to\\r\\nwaste time. By the way, did you give the reporters the information you\\r\\nwere talking about yesterday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. It was printed in last night's _Evening Herald_, and I\\r\\nthink both the _Courier_ and the _Gazette_ have got it this morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton was still scrutinising the advertisement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm like you, Inspector\\xe2\\x80\\x94no great shakes on cyphers. But this affair\\r\\nlooks to me more like the letters of a plain message arranged in\\r\\nordinary alphabetical order. I think that most likely we shall get the\\r\\nkey from the writer in some form or other before long. In the\\r\\nmeantime, though, we might have a dash at interpreting the affair, if\\r\\nwe can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face showed that he thought very poorly of the chances\\r\\nof success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver read Jules Verne or Poe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo? Well, Poe\\r\\nhas an essay on cryptography in its earlier stages\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing like the\\r\\nstuff you'll find in Gross or Reiss, of course, and mere child's play\\r\\ncompared with the special manuals on the subject. But he pointed out\\r\\nthat in cypher-solving you have to pick the lock instead of using the\\r\\nnormal key. And Jules Verne puts his finger on the signature of a\\r\\ncypher-communication as a weak point, if you've any idea who the\\r\\nsender is. That's assuming, of course, that there is a signature at\\r\\nall to the thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector nodded his comprehension of this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean, sir, that \\xe2\\x80\\x98Justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 would be the signature here, like in\\r\\nthe wire we got?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can but try,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot that I'm over-hopeful.\\r\\nStill, it's worth a shot. Suppose we hook out the letters of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand see what that leaves us. And we may as well disregard the groups\\r\\nof five for the moment and simply collect the remaining letters under\\r\\nA, B, C, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tore a sheet of paper into small squares and inscribed one letter\\r\\nof the message on each square.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we take out \\xe2\\x80\\x98Justice,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, suiting the action to the word,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand simply leave the rest in alphabetical groups.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector, following the operation, found himself faced with the\\r\\narrangement:\\r\\n\\r\\n  AAA CCCC D EEEE F HHHHH III NNNN\\r\\n  OOOOOO RR SSSS TTTTTTTTT U W Y\\r\\n  JUSTICE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn't seem much clearer, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough pointed out with a\\r\\ncertain tinge of enjoyment in his tone. It was not often that he had a\\r\\nchance of crowing over his superior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait a moment, Inspector. Just let's reflect for a bit. At any rate,\\r\\nthe letters of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are there; and that's always better than a\\r\\ncomplete blank end. Now consider what Mr. Justice might be burning to\\r\\ntell us about in his unobtrusive way. He had time to see the news\\r\\nprinted in last night's _Herald_ before he composed this little\\r\\naffair. Let's suppose that he got some fresh ideas from that\\xe2\\x80\\x94since\\r\\nthis communication falls pat after the publication and he hasn't\\r\\nbothered us for days before that. The crucial thing was the\\r\\nidentification of the hyoscine. We'll see if we can get the word out\\r\\nhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sifted out the letters rapidly; and the jumble then took the form:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HYOSCINE AAA CCC D EEE F HHHH II\\r\\n  NNN OOOOO RR SSS TTTTTTTTT U W\\r\\n  JUSTICE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt fits, so far,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said, surveying his handiwork\\r\\ndoubtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we might have got a couple of words like that out of\\r\\na random jumble of fifty-six letters. It's encouraging, but far from\\r\\nconvincing, I admit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced over the arrangement with knitted brows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere seem to be a devil of a lot of T's in the thing, if we're on\\r\\nthe right track. Now what do you associate with hyoscine in your mind,\\r\\nInspector? Quick, now! Don't stop to think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Croft-Thornton Institute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the inspector, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBull's eye, I believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable ejaculated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could\\r\\nhardly jam more T's together in English than there are in these three\\r\\nwords. Let's sift 'em out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector bent eagerly forward to see if the necessary letters\\r\\ncould be found. Sir Clinton separated the ones which he required for\\r\\nthe three words, and the arrangement stood thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HYOSCINE THE CROFT-THORNTON\\r\\n  INSTITUTE AAA CC D E HH OO SS TT\\r\\n  W JUSTICE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this is getting outside the bounds of mere chance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton adjudged, with more optimism in his tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we might go a\\r\\nstep further without straining things, even if it's only a short pace.\\r\\nLet's make a guess. Suppose that it's meant to read: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHyoscine _at_\\r\\nthe Croft-Thornton Institute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That leaves us with the jumble here:\\r\\n\\r\\n  AA CC D E HH OO SS T W\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make of that, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe start of it looks like ACCEDE\\xe2\\x80\\x94no, there's only one E,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nFlamborough began, only to correct himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not ACCEDE, obviously, Let's try ACCESS and see if that's any\\r\\nuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable shifted the letters while the Inspector, now\\r\\nthoroughly interested, watched for the result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it's ACCESS then it ought to be ACCESS TO,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that leaves A, D, HH, O, W.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne glance at the six letters satisfied him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's panned out correctly, Inspector. There isn't a letter over.\\r\\nSee!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rearranged the lettering, and the inspector read the complete\\r\\nmessage:\\r\\n\\r\\n  WHO HAD ACCESS TO HYOSCINE AT THE CROFT-THORNTON INSTITUTE.\\r\\n  JUSTICE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe chances of an anagram working out so sensibly as that are pretty\\r\\nsmall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said, with satisfaction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a few million to\\r\\none that we've got the correct version. H'm! I don't know that Mr.\\r\\nJustice has really given us much help this time, for the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton was an obvious source of the drug. Still, he's doing\\r\\nhis best, evidently; and he doesn't mean to let us overlook even the\\r\\nobvious, this time. I'm prepared to bet that we get the key to this\\r\\nthing by the next post. Mr. Justice wouldn't leave the matter to the\\r\\nmere chance of our working the thing out. Still it's some satisfaction\\r\\nto feel that we've done without his assistance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough occupied himself with copying the cypher and its solution\\r\\ninto his notebook. When he had finished, Sir Clinton lit a cigarette\\r\\nand handed his case to the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's put officialism aside for a few minutes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable\\r\\nproposed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo notes, or anything of that sort. Now I don't mind\\r\\nconfessing, Inspector, that we aren't getting on with this business at\\r\\nall well. Short of divination, there seems no way of discovering the\\r\\ntruth, so far as present information goes. And we simply can't afford\\r\\nto let this affair go unsolved. Your Whalley person seems to be our\\r\\nbest hope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector evidently found a fresh train of thought started in his\\r\\nmind by Sir Clinton's lament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been thinking over that set of alternatives you put down on\\r\\npaper the other day, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think they ought to be\\r\\nreduced from nine to six. It's practically out of the question that\\r\\nyoung Hassendean was shot twice over by pure accident; so it seems\\r\\nreasonable enough to eliminate all that class from your table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his hand in his pocket and produced a sheet of paper which had\\r\\nevidently been folded and unfolded fairly often since it had been\\r\\nfirst written upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you reject accident as a possibility in Hassendean's case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen you bring the thing within these limits here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his paper down on the table and Sir Clinton read the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hassendean        Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\n  A\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Suicide\\r\\n  B\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ........ Murder\\r\\n  C\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Accident\\r\\n  D\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ........ Accident\\r\\n  E\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Murder\\r\\n  F\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ........ Suicide\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I think it's possible to eliminate even further than that, sir,\\r\\nfor this reason. There's a third death\\xe2\\x80\\x94the maid's at\\r\\nHeatherfield\\xe2\\x80\\x94which on the face of it is connected in some way with\\r\\nthese others. I don't see how you can cut the Heatherfield business\\r\\naway from the other two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm with you there, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton assured him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, obviously relieved to find that he was not going to be\\r\\nattacked in the flank, pursued his exposition with more confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho killed the maid? That's an important point. It wasn't young\\r\\nHassendean, because the maid was seen alive by Dr. Ringwood\\r\\nimmediately after young Hassendean had died on his hands. It certainly\\r\\nwasn't Mrs. Silverdale, because everything points to her having died\\r\\neven before young Hassendean left the bungalow to go home and die at\\r\\nIvy Lodge. Therefore, there was somebody afoot in the business that\\r\\nnight who wouldn't stick at murder to gain his ends, whatever they\\r\\nwere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody's going to quarrel with that, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, with that factor at the\\r\\nback of one's mind, one might review these six remaining cases in the\\r\\nlight of what we do know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo ahead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton urged him, covertly amused to find the\\r\\nInspector so completely converted to the method which at first he had\\r\\ndecried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCase A, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA double suicide. Now I don't\\r\\ncotton much to that notion, for this reason. If it was suicide, then\\r\\none or other of them must have had possession of hyoscine in quantity\\r\\nsufficient to kill both of them. So I judge from the quantity found in\\r\\nher body. Now no hyoscine was in young Hassendean's system. His eyes\\r\\nwere quite normal and there was no trace of the stuff in the stomach,\\r\\nas they found when they sent to your London friend on the question.\\r\\nFrom what I've seen of young Hassendean's diary, and from what we've\\r\\npicked up about him from various sources, he wasn't the sort of person\\r\\nto go in for needless pain. If he'd shot himself at all, it would have\\r\\nbeen in the head. And if he'd had hyoscine at hand, he wouldn't have\\r\\nshot himself at all. He'd have swallowed a dose of the poison instead,\\r\\nand gone out painlessly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCorrect inference, I believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't say\\r\\nit's certain, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, what holds in Case A, ought to hold also in the other two\\r\\ncases\\xe2\\x80\\x94C and E\\xe2\\x80\\x94where it's also a question of young Hassendean's\\r\\nsuicide. So one can score them off as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so fast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't say you're wrong; but\\r\\nyour assumption doesn't cover the cases. In Case A you assumed that\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale committed suicide\\xe2\\x80\\x94ergo, she had hyoscine in her\\r\\npossession. But in Case C, the assumption is that she died by\\r\\naccidental poisoning; and before you can eliminate suicide on young\\r\\nHassendean's part, you've got to prove that he had the hyoscine in his\\r\\npossession. I'm not saying that he hadn't. I'm merely keeping you\\r\\nstrictly to your logic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough considered this for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrictly speaking, I suppose you're right, sir. And in Case E, I'd\\r\\nhave to prove that he poisoned her wilfully, in order to cover the\\r\\ncase of his having hyoscine in his possession. H'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pause, he took up the table afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's go back to Case B, then: a double murder. That brings in this\\r\\nthird party\\xe2\\x80\\x94the person who did for the maid at Heatherfield, we'll\\r\\nsay; and the fellow who broke the window. There were signs of a\\r\\nstruggle in that room at the bungalow, you remember. Now it seems to\\r\\nme that Case B piles things on too thick, if you understand what I\\r\\nmean. It means that Mrs. Silverdale was murdered by poison and that\\r\\nyoung Hassendean was shot to death. Why the two methods when plain\\r\\nshooting would have been good enough in both cases? Take the obvious\\r\\ncase\\xe2\\x80\\x94it's been at the back of my mind, and I'm sure it's been at the\\r\\nback of yours too, that Silverdale surprised the two of them at the\\r\\nbungalow and killed them both. Where does the poison come in? To my\\r\\nmind we ought to put a pencil through Case B. It's most improbable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRather to his relief, Sir Clinton made no objection. The Inspector\\r\\ndrew his pencil through the first two lines of the table, then let it\\r\\nhover over the last line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about Case F, sir? She suicided and he was murdered. If she\\r\\nsuicided, it was a premeditated affair\\xe2\\x80\\x94otherwise they wouldn't have\\r\\nhad the hyoscine at hand. But if it was one of these lovers\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsuicide-pacts, they'd have had a dose ready for him as well\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there\\r\\nwasn't a trace of the stuff spilt on the floor or anywhere about the\\r\\nbungalow. Score out Case F, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've no objections to your putting your pencil through it if you\\r\\nlike, Inspector, though my reasons are rather different from the ones\\r\\nyou give.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough looked up suspiciously, but gathered from Sir Clinton's\\r\\nface that there was nothing further to be expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, at least that's narrowed down the possibilities a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\nwith relief. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou started out with nine possible solutions to the\\r\\naffair\\xe2\\x80\\x94covering every conceivable combination. Now we're down to\\r\\nthree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up his paper and read out the residual scheme, putting fresh\\r\\nidentifying letters to the three cases:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hassendean        Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\n  X\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Accident\\r\\n  Y\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ........ Accident\\r\\n  Z\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Murder\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou agree to that, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted, in a careless tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think the\\r\\ntruth probably lies somewhere among those three solutions. The bother\\r\\nwill be to prove it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment a constable entered the room, bringing some letters and\\r\\na newspaper in a postal wrapper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome by the next post, as I expected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable remarked,\\r\\npicking up the packet and removing the wrapper with care. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe usual\\r\\nmethod of addressing, you see: letters cut from telegraph forms and\\r\\ngummed on to the official stamped wrapper. Well, let's have a look at\\r\\nthe news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unfolded the sheet and glanced over the advertisement pages in\\r\\nsearch of a marked paragraph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIngenious devil, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other advertisement was\\r\\nin the _Courier_, this is a copy of to-day's _Gazette_. That makes\\r\\nsure that no one reading down a column of advertisements would be\\r\\nstruck by a resemblance and start comparisons. I begin to like Mr.\\r\\nJustice. He's thorough, anyhow. . . . Ah, here we are! Marked like the\\r\\nother one. Listen, Inspector:\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCLINTON: Take the letters in the following order.\\r\\n  55. 16. 30. 17. 1. 9. 2. 4. 5. 10. 38. 39. 43. 31.\\r\\n  18. 56. 32. 40. 6. 21. 26. 11. 3. 44. 45. 19. 12. 7.\\r\\n  36. 33. 15. 46. 47. 20. 34. 37. 27. 48. 35. 28. 22.\\r\\n  29. 41. 49. 23. 50. 53. 51. 13. 25. 54. 42. 52.\\r\\n  24. 8. 14.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that was why he split up his letters into groups of five in the\\r\\nfirst advertisement\\xe2\\x80\\x94to make it easy for us to count. I really like\\r\\nthis fellow more and more. A most thoughtful cove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe placed the two advertisements side by side on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust run over this with me, Inspector. Call the first A number 1, the\\r\\nsecond A number 2, and so on. There are fifty-six letters in all, so\\r\\nnumber 55 is the W. Number 16 is the first letter in the fourth\\r\\nquintette\\xe2\\x80\\x94H. Number 30 is the last letter in the sixth quintette\\xe2\\x80\\x94O. So\\r\\nthat spells WHO. Just go through the lot and check them please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough ploughed through the whole series and ended with the same\\r\\nsolution as Sir Clinton had obtained earlier in the morning: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWHO HAD\\r\\nACCESS TO HYOSCINE AT THE CROFT-THORNTON INSTITUTE?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it's pleasant to hit the mark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable confessed.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, you had better send someone down to the _Courier_ and\\r\\n_Gazette_ Offices to pick up the originals of these advertisements.\\r\\nBut I'm sure it'll be just the same old telegram stunt; and the\\r\\naddress which has to be given as a guarantee of good faith will be a\\r\\nfake one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Silverdale Wills\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Mr. Renard, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough held open the door of Sir Clinton's office and ushered in\\r\\nthe little Frenchman. The Chief Constable glanced up at the\\r\\ninterruptors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Silverdale's brother, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked courteously.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard nodded vigorously, and turned toward the Inspector, as though\\r\\nleaving explanations to him. Flamborough threw himself into the\\r\\nbreach:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt appears, sir, that Mr. Renard isn't entirely satisfied with the\\r\\nstate of things he's unearthed in the matter of his sister's will.\\r\\nIt's taken him by surprise; and he came to see what I thought about\\r\\nit. He'd prefer to lay the point before you, so I've brought him\\r\\nalong. It seems just as well that you should hear it at first-hand,\\r\\nfor it looks as though it might be important.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton closed his fountain pen and invited Renard to take a seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm at your disposal, Mr. Renard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said briskly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's hear the\\r\\nwhole story, if you please, whatever it is. Inspector Flamborough will\\r\\nmake notes, if you don't mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard took the chair which Sir Clinton indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be concise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he assured the Chief Constable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not a\\r\\nvery complicated affair, but I should like to have it thrashed out, as\\r\\nyou English say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe settled himself at ease and then plunged into his tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sister, Yvonne Renard, as you know, married Mr. Silverdale in\\r\\n1923. I was not altogether pleased with the alliance, not quite\\r\\nsatisfied, you understand? Oh, there was nothing against Mr.\\r\\nSilverdale! But I knew my sister, and Silverdale was not the right man\\r\\nfor her: he was too serious, too intent on his profession. He had not\\r\\nthe natural gaiety which was needed in a husband for Yvonne. Already I\\r\\nwas in doubt, at the very moment of the marriage. There were\\r\\nincompatibilities, you understand. . . . ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's gesture assured him that he had made himself\\r\\nsufficiently clear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have nothing to say against my brother-in-law, you follow me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nRenard went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a case of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Marry in haste and repent at\\r\\nleisure,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as your English proverb says. They were unsuited to each\\r\\nother, but that was no fault of theirs. When they discovered each\\r\\nother\\xe2\\x80\\x94their real selves\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is clear that they decided to make the best\\r\\nof it. I had nothing to say. I was sorry that my sister had not found\\r\\na husband more suited to her temperament; but I am not one who would\\r\\nmake trouble by sympathising too much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI quite understand, Mr. Renard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton intervened, with the\\r\\nobvious intention of cutting short this elaborate exposition of the\\r\\nself-evident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I come to the important point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the time of\\r\\nthe marriage, or shortly afterwards\\xe2\\x80\\x94I do not know your English law\\r\\nabout testaments very well\\xe2\\x80\\x94my brother-in-law transferred part of his\\r\\nproperty in stocks and shares to my sister. It was some question of\\r\\nDeath Duties, I was told. If he died first, then she would have had to\\r\\npay on his whole estate; but by transferring some of his property to\\r\\nher, this could be avoided. In case of his death, she would have to\\r\\npay only on what he had retained in his own name. It is, I understand,\\r\\na usual precaution in the circumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's often done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, Mr. Renard, can\\r\\nyou give me some idea of how much he transferred to her on their\\r\\nmarriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot give you the precise figures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nseen the lawyer's accounts, of course; but they were involved, and I\\r\\nhave no good memory for figures. It was only a few hundred pounds\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nmere drop in the bucket, as you would say in English. My\\r\\nbrother-in-law is not a rich man, not by any means. But the sum itself\\r\\nis of little importance. It is the sequel which is of more interest,\\r\\nas you shall see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned forward in his chair as though to fix Sir Clinton's\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen my brother-in-law transferred this little property to my sister,\\r\\nthey each made their testament. That, I believe, was on the advice of\\r\\na lawyer. By his will, my brother-in-law left all his property to my\\r\\nsister. He had no relations, so far as I have learned; and that seemed\\r\\nvery fair. The second will, my sister's, was in identical terms, so\\r\\nfar as the principal clauses went. All her property in stocks, shares,\\r\\nand money, went to my brother-in-law. There was a little provision at\\r\\nthe end which left to me a few small souvenirs, things of sentimental\\r\\nvalue only. It seemed very fair in the circumstances. I suggest\\r\\nnothing wrong. How could there be anything wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems a normal precaution in the circumstances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nassured him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNaturally, if she died first, he would expect to get his\\r\\nown property back again\\xe2\\x80\\x94less the Death Duties, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a very small affair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard emphasised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had been\\r\\nconsulted, I should certainly have advised it. But I was not\\r\\nconsulted. It was no business of mine, except that I was made a\\r\\ntrustee. I am not one who mixes himself up with affairs which do not\\r\\nconcern him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is this leading to, Mr. Renard?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton asked patiently.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't see your difficulty as yet, I must confess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no difficulty. It is merely that I wish to lay some further\\r\\ninformation before you. Now, I proceed. My aunt had been ill for a\\r\\nlong time. A disease of the heart, it was: angina pectoris. She was\\r\\nbound to die in a spasm, at a moment's notice. One expected it, you\\r\\nunderstand? And less than three weeks ago, she had the spasm which we\\r\\nhad so long anticipated, and she died.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face expressed his sympathy, but he made no attempt to\\r\\ninterrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I told Inspector Flamborough when I saw him last,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard\\r\\ncontinued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe figure of her fortune came as a surprise to me. I had\\r\\nno idea she was so rich. She lived very simply, very parsimoniously,\\r\\neven. I had always thought of her as hard-up, you understand? Figure\\r\\nto yourself my astonishment when I learned that she had accumulated\\r\\nover \\xc2\\xa312,000! That is a great sum. Many people would do almost\\r\\nanything to acquire \\xc2\\xa312,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused for a moment as though in rapt contemplation of the figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer testament was very simple,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he proceeded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sister Yvonne was\\r\\nher favourite. My aunt had always put her in front of me. I make no\\r\\ncomplaint, you understand? Someone must be preferred. I had a little\\r\\nbequest under my aunt's testament; but Yvonne secured almost the whole\\r\\nof my aunt's fortune. That was how things stood a fortnight ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hitched himself in his chair as though preparing for a revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sister and I were the trustees under my aunt's testament. The\\r\\nlawyer who had charge of the will communicated with me and forwarded a\\r\\ncopy of the document. These legal documents are not easy to\\r\\nunderstand. But I soon saw that my sister had acquired the whole of my\\r\\naunt's capital in stocks and shares\\xe2\\x80\\x94about a million and a half francs.\\r\\nI am not very good at legal affairs. It took me some time to\\r\\nunderstand what all this meant; but I thought it out. It is really\\r\\nquite simple, very easy. My sister had gained \\xc2\\xa312,000 under my aunt's\\r\\nwill; but if she died without any change in the circumstances, then\\r\\nunder the will which she signed after her marriage, my brother-in-law\\r\\nwould inherit the whole of that money. Figure to yourself, he had\\r\\nnever even seen my aunt, and all that \\xc2\\xa312,000 would pour into his lap.\\r\\nAnd I, who had been almost like a son to my aunt, I would get nothing!\\r\\nI make no complaint, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face betrayed nothing whatever of his views on the\\r\\nquestion. He merely waited in silence for Renard to continued his\\r\\nstory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I understood the position,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard resumed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sat down and\\r\\nwrote a letter to my sister. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Here is the state of affairs,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Our good aunt is dead, and she has named you as her heiress. A whole\\r\\nmillion and a half francs! To me she has left some little things,\\r\\nenough at least to buy a suit of mourning. I have no complaints to\\r\\nmake: our good aunt had the right to dispose of her money as she\\r\\nchose.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That was how I began, you understand? Then I went on thus:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Things are for the best for the present,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98but one must think\\r\\nof the future as well. Recall the will which you made at the time of\\r\\nyour marriage. All is to go to your husband, should anything happen to\\r\\nyou. Now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that seems to me hardly as it should be. If you\\r\\nshould die\\xe2\\x80\\x94a motor accident might happen any day\\xe2\\x80\\x94then all the money of\\r\\nour aunt would pass into the hands of your husband, this husband with\\r\\nwhom you have so little in common and who had no relations with our\\r\\ngood aunt. And I, who am your nearest in kin, would receive not one\\r\\npenny. Think of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and consider whether it would be\\r\\nfair. Is the fortune of our family to pass into the hands of strangers\\r\\nand we ourselves to be left without a share in it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRenard looked from the Inspector to Sir Clinton and back to the\\r\\nInspector, as though seeking for sympathy. Apparently finding nothing\\r\\nvery satisfying in their expressions, he continued his tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI put it to her that this state of affairs was not as it should be. I\\r\\ndid not plead for myself, of course. That is not my way. I tried to\\r\\nshow her that as things stood, injustice would be done if she should\\r\\nhappen to die. And I urged her very strongly to make a fresh will.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98See,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x98how things would fall out. To you, it would mean\\r\\nnothing, very naturally. You would be far beyond all cares. But this\\r\\nmoney would be left. Would you desire that it should fall into the\\r\\nhands of this husband of yours, with whom you cannot find anything in\\r\\ncommon? Or would you not prefer that it should be left to your brother\\r\\nwho has always been good to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That is how I put it to her. I asked\\r\\nher to take swift action and to call in a lawyer who could aid her to\\r\\ndraw up a fresh will which would be fair to both her husband and\\r\\nmyself. I desired to be fair, you understand? merely to be fair. He\\r\\nwould have received back his own stocks and shares which he had given\\r\\nto her at the time of their marriage. I would have gained the fortune\\r\\nwhich descended from my aunt. That seemed reasonable, surely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confirmed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit sounds quite reasonable in the\\r\\ncircumstances. And what happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been to see the lawyers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFigure to yourself\\r\\nwhat I discovered. My poor Yvonne was not a woman of affairs. She had\\r\\nno business-like habits. If a thing seemed likely to give her trouble,\\r\\nshe would put it aside for as long as she could, before dealing with\\r\\nit. Affairs bored her. It was her temperament, like that. So when she\\r\\nreceived my letter, she put it aside for some days. One cannot blame\\r\\nher. It was not in her nature to go to great trouble over a thing like\\r\\nthat. Besides, death was not in her thoughts. One day was as good as\\r\\nanother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, as though wishing to heighten the interest of his\\r\\nnarrative; for it was evident that he had produced but little\\r\\nimpression on Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had a good heart, my poor sister. She understood the position\\r\\nwell enough, it seems. And she had no wish to see her good brother\\r\\nleft out in the cold, as you English put it. But she delayed and\\r\\ndelayed in the affair. And in the end she delayed too long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he hitched himself forward in his chair, as though he were\\r\\napproaching something important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went to the lawyers. What did I find? This. My poor Yvonne had not\\r\\nforgotten her good brother. She had the intention of setting things\\r\\nright. One day she rang up the lawyers on the telephone and made an\\r\\nappointment with them for the following afternoon. She informed them\\r\\nthat she proposed to alter her will; but of course, over the\\r\\ntelephone, she said nothing about her wishes on the point. That is to\\r\\nbe understood. But she said she would jot down the points to be\\r\\nembodied in the new will and bring that paper with her. That is all\\r\\nthe lawyers know. That is all I know myself. For before the next\\r\\nafternoon, when she had made her appointment with the lawyers\\xe2\\x80\\x94my poor\\r\\nYvonne was dead! Is it not distressing? Twelve thousand pounds! A\\r\\nmillion and a half francs! And they slip through my fingers just by a\\r\\nfew hours. But I make no complaint, of course. I do not grumble. It is\\r\\nnot my way. These things happen, and one has to bear them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had expected to read any sympathy in Sir Clinton's face, he must\\r\\nhave been disappointed. The Chief Constable betrayed nothing of the\\r\\nfeelings in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it not most inopportune?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Renard continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr most opportune\\r\\nindeed, for Silverdale, that things fell out as they have done. A\\r\\ncoincidence, of course. Life is full of these things. I have seen too\\r\\nmany to be astonished, myself. But is it not most apt that she should\\r\\ndie just at that juncture? Another day of life, and the twelve\\r\\nthousand pounds goes into one pocket; a death, and the money falls\\r\\ninto other hands. I am something of a philosopher. One has to be, in\\r\\nthis world. And these strange chances have an attraction for my mind.\\r\\nI know there is nothing behind them, nothing whatever, you understand?\\r\\nAnd yet, is it not most striking that things fall out as they do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable declined to be drawn into a general discussion on\\r\\nthe Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid it is scarcely a matter for the police, Mr. Renard. Wills\\r\\nhardly fall into our province, you know, unless a case of forgery\\r\\nturns up; and in this case there's nothing of that sort. The only\\r\\nadvice I could give you would be to consult a lawyer, but as you've\\r\\nalready had the legal position made clear, I don't see that there's\\r\\nanything to be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough took his cue and, without more ado he hinted to\\r\\nRenard very plainly that enough time had been spent on the matter. At\\r\\nlength the little Frenchman withdrew, leaving the two officials\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't much care for his way of telling his story, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\nremarked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I'm not sure, if I were in his shoes, that I wouldn't\\r\\nfeel much the same as he seems to do. It must be a bit galling to lose\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa312,000 by a few hours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 delay. And he's quite reasonably suspicious,\\r\\nevidently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton refused to be drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't let's be too much influenced by the stop press news, Inspector.\\r\\nRenard's evidence is the latest we have; but that adds nothing to its\\r\\nvalue, remember. Look at the case as a whole and try to reckon up the\\r\\npeople who could conceivably gain anything by the crime. Then you can\\r\\nassess the probabilities in each case\\xe2\\x80\\x94apart altogether from the order\\r\\nin which the facts have come to light.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector had evidently considered the matter already from this\\r\\nstand-point. He hardly paused before offering his views.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, if you ask me, Silverdale had at least two sound motives\\r\\nfor committing murder. By getting his wife out of the way, he opened\\r\\nthe road to a marriage with the Deepcar girl, whom he's obviously keen\\r\\non. Also, if Renard's story's true, the death of his wife at that\\r\\nparticular juncture put \\xc2\\xa312,000 into his pocket, which he'd have lost\\r\\nif Mrs. Silverdale had lived a day or two longer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne has to admit that he hadn't evidence to get a divorce, which\\r\\nwould have been an obvious alternative to murder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nacknowledged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the cash affair makes the death of Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\npeculiarly opportune. It's no use burking the plain fact that either\\r\\nmoney or a woman might tempt a man to murder; and when you've got both\\r\\nof them together, one can't brush them aside cavalierly. But go on\\r\\nwith your list, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's that money-lender, Spratton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough pursued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf young\\r\\nHassendean's death can be proved to be a murder, then Spratton lifts\\r\\nsome thousands out of the pocket of the insurance company in return\\r\\nfor the payment of a single premium. That's a motive, certainly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a sound motive for _proving_ that it was a case of murder and\\r\\nnot suicide; and it's a possible motive for murder, I admit. But the\\r\\nposition of a gentleman who commits a murder for gain and can only\\r\\ncollect the money by proving that murder was done . . . Well, it\\r\\nsounds a bit complicated, doesn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnless he can be sure of fixing the murder on someone else, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a bit difficult in practice to produce a frame-up of that\\r\\ndescription, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector refrained from betraying any opinion on this point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen there's the Hailsham girl, sir. She's a vindictive type; and she\\r\\nquite obviously had the worst kind of grudge against both of them.\\r\\nRevenge might have been at the back of the business for all one can\\r\\ntell. I don't say it's likely; but I'm considering possibilities, not\\r\\nnecessarily probabilities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't think Miss Hailsham can reckon me among her admirers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that's hardly evidence against her in a murder\\r\\ncase. We'd need something a bit more concrete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe admitted that she left the dance early that night and took her\\r\\ncar home, sir. She hasn't got a clean alibi for the time the murder\\r\\nwas committed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I noticed when she told her story. But the absence of an alibi\\r\\ndoesn't establish murderous intent, you know. Go ahead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, there's the Deepcar girl. She's keen on Silverdale. It's\\r\\nalways a motive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSave me from being mixed up in any murder case that you have charge\\r\\nof, Inspector. My character wouldn't escape, I see. You'll need to\\r\\nhave something better than that before you start arresting anyone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not talking about arresting anyone, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector replied\\r\\nin an injured tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm just reviewing possible motives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite true. Can't one make a feeble joke without rasping your\\r\\nsusceptibilities? Now is that the end of your list?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think so, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! You didn't think of including someone with the initial \\xe2\\x80\\x98B,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then?\\r\\nYou remember the \\xe2\\x80\\x98B\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the bracelet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector seemed rather startled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean this fellow B. might have been a discarded lover of Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's who was out for revenge like the Hailsham girl? I hadn't\\r\\nthought of that. It's possible, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow let's turn to a fresh side of the case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne thing's certain; hyoscine played a part in the affair. What about\\r\\nMr. Justice's pertinent inquiry: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who had access to hyoscine at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery blessed soul in the place, so far as I could see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\nInspector confessed, rather ruefully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilverdale, Markfield, young\\r\\nHassendean, and the two girls: they all had equal chances of helping\\r\\nthemselves from that bottle in the store. I don't think that leads\\r\\nvery far. That hyoscine was common property so far as access to it\\r\\nwent. Anyone might have taken some.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen push the thing a little further. Out of all that list, who had\\r\\nan opportunity of administering hyoscine to Mrs. Silverdale\\xe2\\x80\\x94directly\\r\\nor indirectly\\xe2\\x80\\x94on the night she died?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirectly or indirectly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough mused. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's something in\\r\\nthat perhaps. On the face of it, only three people could have\\r\\nadministered the drug directly, since there were only three people at\\r\\nHeatherfield in a fit state to do it. I take it that she swallowed the\\r\\nstuff at Heatherfield, sir, because I found no trace of a paper which\\r\\nmight have held it, either at the bungalow or on the bodies of young\\r\\nHassendean and Mrs. Silverdale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's sound, I believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton acquiesced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe swallowed the\\r\\nstuff at Heatherfield before going out. Now who are your three\\r\\nsuspects?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Silverdale herself might have taken it, sir, either on purpose\\r\\nor by mistake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she had no access to hyoscine that we know of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, but both Silverdale and young Hassendean had. She may have\\r\\ntaken it in mistake for a headache powder or something of that sort.\\r\\nAnd it might have been added to a headache powder by either Silverdale\\r\\nor young Hassendean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a good enough suggestion, Inspector. But I didn't see any sign\\r\\nof a powder paper in her room when I searched it; and you remember she\\r\\ncame straight downstairs and went out of the house, according to the\\r\\nmaid's evidence. Any other view?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen it must have been administered in the coffee, sir, by either\\r\\nyoung Hassendean or the maid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe maid? Where would she get hyoscine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Silverdale, sir. It's just occurred to me. Silverdale wanted a\\r\\ndivorce; but he couldn't get evidence because his wife was simply\\r\\nplaying with young Hassendean and keeping well within the limits. But\\r\\nif she were drugged, then young Hassendean might seize the chance that\\r\\nwas offered to him, and if Silverdale was prepared beforehand, he'd\\r\\nhave his evidence at the cost of watching them for an hour or two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo Silverdale gave the maid the drug to put in one of the cups of\\r\\ncoffee and ordered her to give that cup to Mrs. Silverdale, you\\r\\nthink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's possible, sir. I don't put it higher. That maid was a simple\\r\\ncreature\\xe2\\x80\\x94look how the doctor pumped her on the pretence of getting\\r\\nmedical information that night. She was devoted to Silverdale; he told\\r\\nus that himself. She'd swallow any talk he chose to hand out to her.\\r\\nSuppose he faked up some yarn about Mrs. Silverdale needing a sedative\\r\\nbut refusing to take it. The maid would believe that from Silverdale,\\r\\nand she'd put the hyoscine into the cup quite innocently. If the worst\\r\\ncame to the worst, and the cups got mixed, then young Hassendean would\\r\\nget the dose instead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's asking a bit too much, I'm afraid. Remember it was a heavy\\r\\nover-dose that was given.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverybody's liable to make a mistake, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue. And I suppose you'd say that after the murder at the bungalow\\r\\nSilverdale awoke to the fact that the maid's evidence about the\\r\\nhyoscine would hang him, probably; so he went back and murdered her\\r\\nalso.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was someone well known to her who did her in, sir. That's clear\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the meantime, you've left aside the possibility that young\\r\\nHassendean may have administered the stuff. How does that strike you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's possible, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector admitted cautiously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there's\\r\\nno evidence for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I shouldn't like to go so far as that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said,\\r\\nchaffingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you what evidence there is on the point.\\r\\nThere's Hassendean's own diary, first of all. Then there's what we\\r\\nfound in young Hassendean's laboratory notebook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that was just some stuff about weighing potash-bulbs, whatever\\r\\nthey may be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite correct. That was what it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I'm no chemist, sir. It's off my beat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no chemistry in it. I gave you the key to it at the time.\\r\\nThen there's other evidence. Young Hassendean was a careless worker.\\r\\nEveryone agreed on that; and his notebook confirmed it. Next, there's\\r\\nwhat Miss Hailsham said about hyoscine, which is more or less common\\r\\nknowledge, nowadays, of course. And there's young Hassendean's\\r\\ninterference in the serving of coffee at Heatherfield, that night.\\r\\nFinally, there's what the maid said about Mrs. Silverdale's appearance\\r\\nwhen she was going out of the house. Put all these points together,\\r\\nand I'll engage to satisfy a jury that young Hassendean administered\\r\\nthe hyoscine to Mrs. Silverdale in her coffee, with a definite\\r\\npurpose\\xe2\\x80\\x94but not murder\\xe2\\x80\\x94in view.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll need to think over all that, sir. You seem pretty sure about\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm practically certain. Now look at the business from another\\r\\nstand-point. Who had a grudge against the two victims, either\\r\\nseparately or together?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilverdale, obviously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cObviously, as you say. That's if you take them together, of course.\\r\\nNow for a final problem. Who is Mr. Justice? He seems to be in the\\r\\nknow, somehow. If we could lay hands on him, we might be near the\\r\\ncentre of things. He knew before anyone else that something had\\r\\nhappened at the bungalow. He knew about the hyoscine at the\\r\\nInstitute\\xe2\\x80\\x94although as Silverdale's a fairly well-recognised authority\\r\\non alkaloids, that might have been just a shot aimed on chance.\\r\\nAnyhow, look at it as you choose, Mr. Justice has information, and he\\r\\nseems to have a motive. Who is he, can you guess?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody who won't come out into the open until he's dragged there,\\r\\nevidently. It might be an unwilling accomplice, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's possible. Anyone else?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might be Spratton. He's got an interest in establishing that it\\r\\nwas a case of murder and not suicide.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cObviously true. Anyone else?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't think of anyone else who would fit the case, sir. By the way,\\r\\nI've got the originals of these advertisements\\xe2\\x80\\x94the code ones. I sent\\r\\ndown to the newspaper offices and got hold of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe produced two sheets of paper from his pocket-book and handed them\\r\\nto the Chief Constable. Sir Clinton glanced over them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! The first one\\xe2\\x80\\x94the letters\\xe2\\x80\\x94is built up as usual from telegram\\r\\nforms. The one with the numbers is fitted together from numbers\\r\\nprinted in a newspaper; it might have been clipped from one of these\\r\\nlists of the results of drawings of bonds for redemption\\xe2\\x80\\x94Underground\\r\\nElectric Railways, and that kind of thing. These advertisements have\\r\\ncolumns and columns of figures out of which he'd be able to pick what\\r\\nhe wanted easily enough. Now what about this address that he's put\\r\\ndown\\xe2\\x80\\x94the usual guarantee of good faith at the bottom. It's fictitious,\\r\\nof course?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. There's no such place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's in writing. It looks like a girl's writing. This is a dangerous\\r\\ngame for Mr. Justice; but I suppose if he'd put all the advertisement\\r\\nin clipped-out letters the newspaper people might have got suspicious\\r\\nand refused to print it. What about this handwriting, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's expression showed that he felt he had done his work\\r\\nthoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI managed to get hold of specimens of the writing of Miss Hailsham\\r\\nand Miss Deepcar. It isn't either of them. Then I tried to get it\\r\\nrecognised\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I succeeded, sir. Miss Hailsham recognised it at once.\\r\\nIt's Mrs. Silverdale's own writing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA forgery, then? That's very neat of Mr. Justice. I feel inclined to\\r\\ntake off my hat to that fellow. He thinks of everything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it's a blank end for us, so far as I can see, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed to be so lost in admiration of Mr. Justice's\\r\\ningenuity that he failed to notice Flamborough's dissatisfaction. When\\r\\nhe spoke again, it was on a different topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about your friend, Mr. Whalley, Inspector? It seems to me we\\r\\nought to have him up and put him through it as quick as possible.\\r\\nQuite obviously he knows something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've tried to get hold of him, sir. But he's left the town and I\\r\\ncan't get on his track. He's gone off to some race-meeting or other, I\\r\\nexpect. He often goes off like that and leaves no address. I'll lay\\r\\nhands on him as soon as he comes back to Westerhaven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's an essential witness, I suspect; so don't let him slip through\\r\\nyour fingers. You'd better ask for assistance from the local police in\\r\\nlikely places.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Inspector, how are you getting along with the game of\\r\\neliminations? How low have you brought the possibles out of the\\r\\noriginal nine solutions?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough produced his often-unfolded scrap of paper and scanned it\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf one accepts what you said a minute or two ago, sir, then the\\r\\ndrugging of Mrs. Silverdale was meant to be plain drugging and wasn't\\r\\nwilful murder. So the last case drops out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his pencil through the line of writing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat leaves only two alternatives:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hassendean        Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\n  X\\xe2\\x80\\x94Suicide ....... Accident\\r\\n  Y\\xe2\\x80\\x94Murder ........ Accident\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd young Hassendean, from all accounts, was hardly the lad to suicide\\r\\nby shooting himself twice in the body\\xe2\\x80\\x94too painful for him. So it\\r\\nreally looks rather like Case Y. Certainly it's coming down to brass\\r\\ntacks quicker than I thought it would.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Murder of the Informer\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he entered Sir Clinton's office on the following morning, Inspector\\r\\nFlamborough blurted out bad news without any preliminary beating about\\r\\nthe bush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's been another murder, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced, with a tinge of what\\r\\nseemed grievance in his tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton looked up from the mass of papers upon his desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is it, this time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's that fellow Whalley, sir\\xe2\\x80\\x94the man who seemed to have some\\r\\ninformation about the bungalow affair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable leaned back in his chair and gazed at Flamborough\\r\\nwith an expressionless face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is really growing into a wholesale trade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, drily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour\\r\\nmurders in quick succession, and we've nothing to show for it. We\\r\\ncan't go on waiting until all the population of Westerhaven, bar one\\r\\nindividual, is exterminated; and then justify ourselves by arresting\\r\\nthe sole survivor on suspicion. The public's getting restive,\\r\\nInspector. It wants to know what we do for our money, I gather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough looked resentful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe public'll have to lump it, if it doesn't like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\ncrudely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've done my best. If you think I ought to hand the thing\\r\\nover to someone else, sir, I'll be only too glad to do so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not criticising you, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton reassured him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot\\r\\nbeing a member of the public\\xe2\\x80\\x94for this purpose, at least\\xe2\\x80\\x94I know enough\\r\\nto appreciate your difficulties. There's no burking the fact that\\r\\nwhoever's at the back of this affair is a sharper man than the usual\\r\\nclumsy murderer. He hasn't left you much of a chance to pick up usable\\r\\nclues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've followed up every one that he did leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough argued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndon't think I've been exactly idle. But I can't arrest Silverdale\\r\\nmerely because I picked up his cigarette-holder in suspicious\\r\\nsurroundings. Confound the public! It doesn't understand the\\r\\ndifference between having a suspicion and being able to prove a case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet's hear the details of this latest affair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton demanded,\\r\\nputting aside the other subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been trying to get hold of this fellow Whalley for the last day\\r\\nor two, sir, so as to follow up that line as soon as possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\nInspector began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, as I told you, he's been away from\\r\\nWesterhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x94hasn't been seen anywhere in his usual haunts. I've made\\r\\nrepeated inquiries at his lodgings, but could get no word of him\\r\\nexcept that he'd gone off. He'd left no word about coming back; but he\\r\\nobviously did mean to turn up again, for he left all his traps there\\r\\nand said nothing about giving up his bedroom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn't get on his track elsewhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I hardly expected it. He's a very average-looking man and one\\r\\ncouldn't expect people to pick him out of a crowd at a race-meeting by\\r\\nhis appearance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded as a permission to the Inspector to continue his\\r\\nnarrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis morning, shortly before seven o'clock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough continued,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe driver of a milk-lorry on the Lizardbridge Road noticed something\\r\\nin the ditch by the roadside. It was about half an hour before\\r\\nsunrise, so I expect he still had his lamps alight. It's pretty dark,\\r\\nthese misty mornings. Anyhow, he saw something sticking up out of the\\r\\nditch and he stopped his lorry. Then he made out that it was a hand\\r\\nand arm; so he got down from his seat and had a closer look. I expect\\r\\nhe took it for a casual drunk sleeping things off quietly. However,\\r\\nwhen he got up to the side of the road, he found the body of a man in\\r\\nthe ditch, face downward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis milkman was a sensible fellow, it seems. He felt the flesh where\\r\\nhe could get at it without moving the body; and the coldness of it\\r\\nsatisfied him that he'd got a deader on his hands. So instead of\\r\\nmuddling about and trampling all over the neighbourhood, he very\\r\\nsensibly got aboard his lorry again and drove in towards town in\\r\\nsearch of a policeman. When he met one, he and the constable went back\\r\\non the lorry to the dead man; and the constable stood on guard whilst\\r\\nthe milkman set off with the lorry again to give the alarm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you go down yourself, by any chance, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. The constable happened to recognise Whalley from what he\\r\\ncould see of him\\xe2\\x80\\x94I told you he was pretty well known to our men\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nknowing that I'd been making inquiries about the fellow, they called\\r\\nme up, and I went down at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I got there, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit didn't take long\\r\\nto see what was what. It was a case of the tourniquet again. Whalley\\r\\nhad been strangled, just like the maid at Heatherfield. Quite obvious\\r\\nsymptoms: face swollen and congested; tongue swollen, too; eyes wide\\r\\nopen and injected a bit, with dilated pupils; some blood on the mouth\\r\\nand nostrils. And when I had a chance of looking for it, there was the\\r\\nmark of the tourniquet on his neck sure enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough paused, as though to draw attention to his next point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hunted about in the ditch, of course. And there, lying quite\\r\\nopenly, was the tourniquet itself. Quite a complicated affair this\\r\\ntime; he's evidently improved his technique.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, what about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton demanded rather testily, as though\\r\\nimpatient of the Inspector's comments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere it is, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough produced the lethal instrument with something of a\\r\\nflourish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see, sir, it's made out of a banjo-string threaded through a bit\\r\\nof rubber tubing. The handles are just bits of wood cut from a\\r\\ntree-branch, the same as before; but the banjo-string and the rubber\\r\\ntube are a vast improvement on the bit of twine he used last time, at\\r\\nHeatherfield. There'd be no chance of the banjo-string breaking under\\r\\nthe strain; and the rubber tube would distribute the pressure and\\r\\nprevent the wire cutting into the flesh as it would have done if it\\r\\nhad been used bare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton picked up the tourniquet and examined it with obvious\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! I don't say you've much to go on, but there's certainly more\\r\\nhere than there was in the other tourniquet. The banjo-string's not\\r\\nmuch help, of course; one can buy 'em in any musical-instrument shop.\\r\\nBut the rubber tubing might suggest something to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough scrutinised it afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's very thick-walled, sir, with a much smaller bore than one would\\r\\nexpect from the outside diameter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's what they call \\xe2\\x80\\x98pressure-tubing\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in a chemical laboratory. It's\\r\\nused when you're pumping out vessels or working under reduced\\r\\npressures generally. That's why it's made so thick-walled: so that it\\r\\nwon't collapse flat under the outside air-pressure when you've pumped\\r\\nall the gas out of the channel in the middle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector, fingering the tubing thoughtfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\nit's the sort of thing one finds in a scientific place like the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlmost certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut don't get too sure about\\r\\nyour rubber tubing. Suppose someone is trying to throw suspicion on\\r\\none of the Croft-Thornton staff, wouldn't this be an excellent way of\\r\\ndoing it? One can buy pressure-tubing in the open market. It's not\\r\\nfound exclusively in scientific institutes, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough seemed a shade crestfallen at the loss of what he had\\r\\nevidently regarded as a promising line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you're right, sir. Still it's a bit\\r\\nuncommon, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot what you'd expect the ordinary criminal to hit on straight off, I\\r\\nsuppose you mean? But this fellow isn't an ordinary criminal. He's got\\r\\nplenty of brains. Now doesn't it strike you as strange that he should\\r\\ngo to the trouble of leaving this tourniquet for your inspection? He\\r\\ncould have slipped it into his pocket easily enough and it wouldn't\\r\\nhave bulged much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, a glance at the body would show anyone that something of\\r\\nthe sort had been used. He wasn't giving much away by leaving the\\r\\nthing itself, was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton did not seem altogether satisfied with the Inspector's\\r\\nview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe less a murderer leaves behind, the more difficult it is to catch\\r\\nhim, Inspector. That's a truism. Now this fellow is no fool, as I've\\r\\nfrequently remarked to you. Hence one might have anticipated that he'd\\r\\nleave as few traces as possible. But here he presents us with the\\r\\nactual weapon, and a weapon that has fairly salient peculiarities of\\r\\nits own. Queer, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you think it's a non-scientific murderer using scientific\\r\\nappliances so as to suggest that the crime was done by someone in the\\r\\nscientific line\\xe2\\x80\\x94Silverdale, I mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton was silent for a moment or two, then he said thoughtfully:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I'm not sure about is whether it's a pure bluff or a double\\r\\nbluff. It looks like one or the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector obviously had difficulty in interpreting this rather\\r\\ncryptic utterance. At last he saw his way through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I see what you mean, sir. Suppose it's not Silverdale that\\r\\ndid the murder. Then somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x94knowing that this kind of tubing's\\r\\ncommon in Silverdale's laboratory\\xe2\\x80\\x94may have left it on purpose for us\\r\\nto find, so that we'd be bluffed into jumping to the conclusion\\xe2\\x80\\x94as I\\r\\nadmit I did\\xe2\\x80\\x94that Silverdale did the trick. That would be a simple\\r\\nbluff. Or again, supposing it's Silverdale who's the murderer, then he\\r\\nmay have left the tubing on purpose, because he'd say to himself that\\r\\nwe'd never believe that he'd be such a fool as to chuck a thing like\\r\\nthat down beside the body\\xe2\\x80\\x94and hence we'd pass him over in our\\r\\nsuspicions. Is that it, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds devilish involved, as you put it, Inspector; but I have a\\r\\nsort of dim perception that you've grasped my meaning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nanswered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy own impression is simply that we musn't let this\\r\\ntourniquet lead us too far, for fear we go completely astray. If we\\r\\nget on the right track, I've no doubt it'll fit neatly enough to the\\r\\nrest of the evidence; but it's not the sort of thing I'd care about\\r\\nstaking a lot on by itself. Now suppose we come out of these flowery\\r\\nby-paths and get back to the main thoroughfare of the facts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector refused to be damped by his superior. Indeed, he had the\\r\\nair of a player holding good cards, and not caring who knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was hard frost last night, sir, as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll remember; so there were\\r\\nno foot-prints on the road, or anything of that sort. But the grass by\\r\\nthe side of the ditch is fairly long; and when I examined it, it was\\r\\nclear enough that there hadn't been any struggle on it. They may have\\r\\nstruggled on the road, of course; but the grass was quite\\r\\nundisturbed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen the body hadn't been dragged off the road into the ditch? It\\r\\nmust have been lifted and pitched in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I think, sir. The grass border between road and ditch is quite\\r\\nnarrow\\xe2\\x80\\x94just room to stand on it comfortably. One could hoist a body\\r\\nover it without too much trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd from the look of the body you think it had been thrown in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. It was huddled up anyhow in the ditch, just as it might\\r\\nhave fallen if it had been dropped in with a thud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSingle-handed business, then, you believe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, I think if two people had been handling him\\xe2\\x80\\x94one taking his\\r\\nshoulders and another taking his feet\\xe2\\x80\\x94he'd have fallen more tidily. He\\r\\ncertainly looked as if he's been bundled in anyhow. I'd put it down as\\r\\na single-handed job from the look of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you examined the pockets, and so forth?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, sir. But there was nothing in _them_ of any use to us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector's voice betrayed that he had something still in reserve.\\r\\nNow he brought it forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI examined his hands, sir; and in the right one, I found something\\r\\nimportant. The hand was clenched, and when I got it open at last, this\\r\\nfell out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe produced a button with a shred of cloth attached to it, which he\\r\\nlaid on the desk before Sir Clinton. The Chief Constable picked it up,\\r\\nexamined it closely, and then, pulling out a pocket magnifying glass,\\r\\nmade a still more minute inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery interesting, Inspector. What do you make of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cObviously it was torn off the murderer's clothes during the struggle,\\r\\nsir. And I've seen something like it before. You see that\\r\\ncanary-coloured stain on the bit of cloth and also on the threads that\\r\\nhold the button to the fabric?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDyed with picric acid, by the look of it, I should say. Is that what\\r\\nyou mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. And the pattern of the cloth's another point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean it looks like a button torn off the old jacket that\\r\\nSilverdale was wearing, that day we saw him at the Croft-Thornton\\r\\nInstitute\\xe2\\x80\\x94his laboratory coat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's undoubtedly what it is, sir. I remember that stain perfectly.\\r\\nAnd as soon as I saw it, I remembered the pattern of the cloth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your view is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that when Silverdale set out to murder Whalley he was afraid\\r\\nthat some blood from the face might get on to his coat. So he put on\\r\\nhis old laboratory jacket. If it got spotted, he could destroy it and\\r\\nrouse no suspicions. It was only an old coat that he might think was\\r\\nworn out. Quite a different thing from destroying some of his ordinary\\r\\nclothes. That would have been suspicious. But an old coat\\xe2\\x80\\x94no one would\\r\\nwonder if he got rid of it and brought another one down to the\\r\\nlaboratory to replace it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds deuced plausible, Inspector, I must admit. But\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton answered thoughtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit leaves us again with\\r\\nthe choice between the single and the double bluff, you see, even if\\r\\none goes no further with one's inquiries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector pondered over the point for a few seconds, but at the\\r\\nend of his cogitation he seemed unimpressed. Apparently, however, he\\r\\nthought it wise to change the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn any case, sir, I think Whalley's part in the bungalow affair is\\r\\npretty plain now. I told you he was the sort of fellow who was out for\\r\\neasy money, no matter how dirty it might be. By the way, he was the\\r\\nman who inquired about the number of that motor which he said knocked\\r\\nhim spinning\\xe2\\x80\\x94an obvious try-on to get damages, although he wasn't hurt\\r\\nat all. You can see he'd do anything to make money and save himself\\r\\nfrom honest work. If you remember that, it's easy enough to see the\\r\\npart he played at the bungalow. He was the person you christened\\r\\nPeeping Tom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything further about him that you can think of, Inspector? I don't\\r\\nsay you're wrong, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, if Silverdale expected to take his wife in _flagrante\\r\\ndelicto_, he'd need an independent witness, wouldn't he? Possibly\\r\\nWhalley was the man he picked out for the work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think he was the sort of witness that was wanted? I'm not so\\r\\nsure of his suitability myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn't exactly a nice job, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector pointed out.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilverdale would hardly care to take one of his close friends to\\r\\ninspect an affair of that sort. And of course a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe broke off suddenly, as though struck by a fresh idea. Sir Clinton\\r\\nignored the last phrase of the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssume that Whalley was the witness, then, what next?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssume that Silverdale posted Whalley at the second window and went\\r\\nround to the first one\\xe2\\x80\\x94at the front. Then, to make the thing complete,\\r\\nhe breaks in through the window and jumps into the room. Young\\r\\nHassendean has his pistol and mistakes the state of affairs\\xe2\\x80\\x94thinks\\r\\nthat Silverdale means to thrash him or worse. He pulls out his pistol\\r\\nand there's a struggle for the possession of it. The pistol goes off\\r\\naccidentally, and the bullet hits Mrs. Silverdale in the head by pure\\r\\nchance. Then the struggle goes on, and in the course of it, young\\r\\nHassendean gets shot twice over in the lung.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable looked at his subordinate with quite unaffected\\r\\nrespect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks as if you'd come very near the truth there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe rest's fairly obvious, if you grant what's gone before. Whalley's\\r\\nseen the whole affair from his post at the window. He sneaks off into\\r\\nthe dark and gets out of Silverdale's reach. If he hadn't, then\\r\\nSilverdale would probably have shot him at sight to destroy the chance\\r\\nof evidence against him. But when Whalley has time to think things\\r\\nover, he sees he's got a gold-mine in the business. If he can\\r\\nblackmail Silverdale, he's got a steady income for life. But I expect\\r\\nhe weakened and tried to play for safety. He blackmailed Silverdale;\\r\\nthen he came to us, so that he could say he'd been to the police,\\r\\nmeaning to give information. Then he went back to Silverdale, and in\\r\\nsome way he let out that he'd given us a call. That would be enough\\r\\nfor Silverdale. Whalley would have to go the way the maid went. And so\\r\\nhe did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton had listened intently to the Inspector's reconstruction of\\r\\nthe episode.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's very neat indeed, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he adjudged at the close. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's\\r\\nquite sound, so far as it goes, and so far as one can see. But, of\\r\\ncourse, it leaves one or two points untouched. Where does the murder\\r\\nof the maid come into the business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough reflected for a moment or two before answering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not prepared to fill that gap just at this moment, sir. But I'll\\r\\nsuggest something. Renard told us that Mrs. Silverdale was going to\\r\\ndraw up a note of the terms of her new will. It's on the cards that\\r\\nSilverdale knew about that\\xe2\\x80\\x94she may have mentioned it to him. He'd want\\r\\nto get that note and destroy it at any cost, before there was any\\r\\nsearch of his house or any hunting through Mrs. Silverdale's\\r\\npossessions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe might have thought it worth while, I admit. But I'd hardly think\\r\\nit important enough to lead to an unnecessary murder. Besides, it\\r\\nwasn't necessary for Silverdale to murder the maid at all. It was his\\r\\nown house. He could search where he chose in it and nobody could\\r\\nobject. The maid wouldn't see anything strange in that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was pretty clear that the maid knew her murderer, anyhow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\nInspector pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverything points to that. I admit I'm only\\r\\nmaking a guess, sir. I can't bring any evidence against Silverdale on\\r\\nthat count yet. For all one can tell, she may have seen\\r\\nsomething\\xe2\\x80\\x94blood on his coat from the shots, or something of that sort.\\r\\nThen he'd have to silence her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton made no comment on the Inspector's suggestion. Instead, he\\r\\nturned to a fresh aspect of the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd where does Mr. Justice come into your theory of the affair? He\\r\\nwasn't your friend Whalley. That's evident.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector rubbed his nose thoughtfully, as though trying to gain\\r\\ninspiration from the friction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a fact, sir, that I can't fit Mr. Justice into my theory at\\r\\npresent. He wasn't Whalley, and that's a fact. But hold on a moment!\\r\\nSuppose that Whalley wasn't Silverdale's witness at all. Come to think\\r\\nof it, Whalley was hardly the sort that one would pick out for the\\r\\njob, if one had been in Silverdale's shoes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm quite convinced of that, at any rate, Inspector. You needn't\\r\\nwaste breath in persuading me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but there's another possibility that's been overlooked, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nFlamborough interrupted eagerly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been assuming all along that\\r\\nSilverdale was the only person at the opened window. But suppose he'd\\r\\nbrought someone along with him. Both of them might have been looking\\r\\nthrough the front window, whilst Whalley was at the side window, quite\\r\\nunknown to them at the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow you're getting positively brilliant, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\ncommended. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you've got at least half the truth there, beyond a\\r\\ndoubt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho could Silverdale's witness have been?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector pursued, as\\r\\nif impatient of the interruption. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about the Deepcar girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton advised him drily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you really suppose\\r\\nthat Silverdale\\xe2\\x80\\x94who seems in love with the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x94would have picked her\\r\\nout for business of that sort? It's incredible, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first flush of enthusiasm at his discovery passed from\\r\\nFlamborough's thoughts at the tone of the Chief Constable's voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you're right, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he had to admit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there's another\\r\\ngirl who'd have enjoyed the job\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that's the Hailsham girl. She'd\\r\\nhave given a good deal just for the pleasure of seeing those two\\r\\nhumiliated. She'd have gloated over the chance of giving that\\r\\nparticular evidence in court and squaring accounts with young\\r\\nHassendean and Mrs. Silverdale. It would have been all jam to her,\\r\\nsir. You can't deny that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton conceded the point without ado.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won't deny it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said curtly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you needn't let your mind run\\r\\nexclusively on the female population of Westerhaven in a matter of\\r\\nthis sort. A man would be a much more convenient witness for\\r\\nSilverdale to take with him. Why leave Silverdale's male friends out\\r\\nof account?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you're thinking of Markfield, sir, we'll not get much out of him,\\r\\nI'm afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough pronounced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far, except when he couldn't\\r\\nhelp it, he's done his level best to refuse any information about\\r\\nSilverdale and his doings\\xe2\\x80\\x94if he hasn't actually served out misleading\\r\\nstatements to us. I don't much care for Dr. Markfield's way of going\\r\\nabout things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton crossed the room and took down his hat from its peg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, let's sample his methods once more, Inspector. We'll go round\\r\\nnow to the Croft-Thornton and look into the question of the jacket.\\r\\nYou can bear the burden of the interview, if you like; but I should\\r\\nprefer to hear what goes on. And you might press Silverdale a little\\r\\nmore sharply about his doings on the night of the bungalow affair. We\\r\\nmay as well give him a chance of second thoughts, though really I\\r\\ndon't expect anything from him at this stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jacket\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton and the Inspector found Markfield at work in his\\r\\nlaboratory when they reached the Croft-Thornton Institute. Flamborough\\r\\nwasted no time in preliminaries, but plunged at once into the business\\r\\nwhich had brought him there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make of that, Dr. Markfield?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded, producing the\\r\\nshred of cloth with the button attached and showing them to the\\r\\nchemist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield examined the object carefully, but his face showed only a\\r\\ncertain bewilderment when he looked up at the Inspector again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems to be a button and a bit of cloth with a picric acid stain\\r\\non it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out with a tinge of irony. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want me to make\\r\\nan expert examination of it? If so, you'd better tell me some more\\r\\nabout it, so that I'll know what you want with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough stared at him for a moment or two, as though trying to\\r\\nread something in his expression, but Markfield seemed in no way put\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not a mind-reader, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll need to\\r\\nexplain clearly what you expect me to do; and I'll have to be told\\r\\nwhether I can cut bits out of your specimen for chemical analysis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough saw that his attempt to draw Markfield was not going to be\\r\\nso easy as he had hoped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave a good look at the thing first of all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you\\r\\nremember anything like it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield stolidly examined the object once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a button and a piece of cloth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I've\\r\\nseen buttons before, and bits of cloth are not uncommon. I should\\r\\nthink that this stain is a picric acid one, but that's a matter for\\r\\nfurther examination before I could say anything definite. Is that what\\r\\nyou wanted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough kept his temper with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I want to know, Dr. Markfield, is whether you have recently seen\\r\\nanything that you could associate with that thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94any garment from\\r\\nwhich it might have been torn, or anything of that sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's eyes narrowed and he glanced with obvious unfriendliness\\r\\nat the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a coat-button, by the look of it. I'm no specialist in buttons,\\r\\nI admit. It might have come off any lounge suit, so far as I can see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'd advise you not to fence with us too long, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nFlamborough suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at the cloth. Does that remind you of\\r\\nanything that's familiar to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face betrayed his obvious annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you've identified it already for yourselves. Why come to\\r\\nme? Presumably you mean that it's a bit torn off Dr. Silverdale's\\r\\nlaboratory coat. Well, I can't swear to that. It may be, for all I\\r\\nknow. Why not compare it with the coat, and if the coat's torn, you've\\r\\ngot your evidence, whatever it may be. I don't see why you drag me\\r\\ninto the thing at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's voice grew hard as he answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's one thing I want you to bear in mind, Dr. Markfield. A man\\r\\nmay very easily become an accessory after the fact in a murder case;\\r\\nand the penalty runs as high as penal servitude for life. I'm not at\\r\\nall satisfied with the way in which you seem to have determined to\\r\\nevade some of the questions I've had to put to you; and I'd like to\\r\\nremind you that you may be running risks. It would be far better if\\r\\nyou'd deal frankly with us instead of shuffling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe covert threat seemed to have its effect on Markfield. He looked\\r\\nsulky, but he appeared to make up his mind to alter his tactics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, ask your questions, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snapped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut put them on matters\\r\\nof fact. I'm not going to say what I _think_ about this and what I\\r\\n_suppose_ about that. I'll tell you anything that I _know_ definitely,\\r\\nif you ask about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough wasted no time before taking up the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good, Dr. Markfield. We'll stick to facts, if you like. Now once\\r\\nupon a time you saw Dr. Silverdale acting in some private theatricals,\\r\\nI believe. I learned that from Dr. Ringwood. That's correct, isn't\\r\\nit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. We were members of a small amateur show at one time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn any of his parts, did Dr. Silverdale play the banjo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield reflected for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's an expert banjo-player?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe plays the banjo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield corrected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not going to give you\\r\\nmy opinion about his playing. That's not a question of fact; it's a\\r\\nmere matter of taste.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough let this pass without comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe plays the banjo, anyhow. That's what I want to get at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped across the laboratory to where a little glass apparatus was\\r\\nattached to a tap at a sink and examined the rubber tubing attached.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat's this thing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA water-pump,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield answered, as though not quite following the\\r\\nInspector's train of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this rubber tubing, what sort of stuff is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPressure-tubing. What about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes Dr. Silverdale use anything of that sort?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverybody in the place uses it. Whenever one wants quick filtering\\r\\none uses a water-pump with pressure-tubing connections.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Deepcar and Miss Hailsham use it, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should think there are a dozen or two of these pumps in this\\r\\ndepartment alone. They're ordinary fittings in every chemical\\r\\nlaboratory. If I may ask, Inspector, what are you getting at?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough switched off to a fresh line without making any direct\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Miss Deepcar here to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't think so. I believe she's out of town\\xe2\\x80\\x94been away for a couple\\r\\nof days. I'll send a message to find out definitely if you want to\\r\\nknow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't trouble. I can find out for myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard that she would be back the day after to-morrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield\\r\\nvolunteered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you'd better find out for yourself of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the Inspector turned to a fresh line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know anything about a man Whalley\\xe2\\x80\\x94Peter Whalley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhalley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield repeated as though trying to recall the name.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhalley? Oh, yes. He came to me with some story about having been hit\\r\\nby my car on a foggy night. I didn't believe him. I knew I'd hurt no\\r\\none with the car, though once I came near it that night. Mr. Whalley\\r\\ngot no change out of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn't go any further in the matter, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard no more about it. The thing was so obviously a try-on that I\\r\\ndidn't even advise my insurance company about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough reflected for a few moments, obviously trying to think of\\r\\nfresh questions which he could put; but apparently he had come to the\\r\\nend of his stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe'll go along to Dr. Silverdale's room,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, leading the way to\\r\\nthe door. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better come with us, Dr. Markfield. You'll do as a\\r\\nwitness, perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not very keen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield retorted grumblingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he followed Sir Clinton and the Inspector along the corridors\\r\\nto Silverdale's laboratory. The room was empty, but the door was\\r\\nunlocked and the Inspector opened it and stepped inside. A glance\\r\\nround the place revealed Silverdale's laboratory jacket hanging on a\\r\\npeg; and Flamborough went over and took it down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we'll see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, laying it on the table and spreading it out\\r\\nfor examination. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, I thought there was no mistake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed to the right-hand side, where it was obvious that one of\\r\\nthe buttons had been wrenched away, taking a piece of the cloth with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we'll see if it fits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough continued, producing the\\r\\nfragment of fabric found in Whalley's hand and adjusting it to the\\r\\ntear in the coat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's clear enough. You see now the stains on the\\r\\ntwo bits correspond exactly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield leaned over and satisfied himself that the Inspector's\\r\\nstatement was accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is this bit of cloth?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, however, had found something further, and Markfield got\\r\\nno answer to his question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector ejaculated, indicating a a small brownish\\r\\nstain on the breast of the jacket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's blood, clear enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed about to repeat his demand for information when steps\\r\\nsounded in the corridor outside. Flamborough picked up the coat, moved\\r\\nswiftly across the room, and hung the garment on its original peg. As\\r\\nhe turned away unconcernedly from the spot, the door opened and\\r\\nSilverdale entered the laboratory. He seemed taken aback by the\\r\\npresence of the police and looked from one to another in the group\\r\\nwithout speaking. Then he came forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, in a colourless voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed rather ashamed at being caught there in the company\\r\\nof the two officials. He was about to say something when Flamborough\\r\\nrobbed him of the opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've come to put one or two questions, Dr. Silverdale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector\\r\\nbegan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, have you had any dealings lately with a man\\r\\nnamed Peter Whalley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale was obviously taken aback.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhalley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know nothing about anyone of that name. Who\\r\\nis he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough seemed to discount this statement, but he did not persist\\r\\nalong that direct line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you tell us what you were doing last night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale reflected for a time before answering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI left here about six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock\\xe2\\x80\\x94between six and six-thirty. Then I\\r\\nwalked down to the Central Hotel and had dinner. I suppose I left the\\r\\nhotel again about a quarter to eight. I walked home, as it was a clear\\r\\nnight; and I did some work until about half-past eleven. After that I\\r\\nwent to bed and read for a while before going to sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough jotted something in his notebook before going further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you could produce some witnesses in support of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale appeared to consult his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI met Miss Hailsham as I was leaving here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would\\r\\ngive you the approximate time, if she remembers it. The waiter at the\\r\\nCentral could probably satisfy you that I was there\\xe2\\x80\\x94it's the tall one\\r\\nwith the wart on his cheek who looks after the tables at the north\\r\\nwindow. After that, you'll have to take my word for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about your maids at Heatherfield?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven't anyone on the premises. No maid would take the place owing\\r\\nto the murder. I merely sleep there and take my meals at an hotel. A\\r\\ncharwoman comes in during the day and cleans the place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector, thoughtfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you can't prove that you\\r\\nwere actually at home after, say, half-past eight? By the way, you\\r\\nhadn't a visitor by any chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I was quite alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough made another note; and then continued his interrogation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you to cast your mind back to the night when Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\ncame by her death. I asked you once before what you were doing that\\r\\nnight, but you put me off. I think you'd find it more advisable to be\\r\\nfrank, now that I'm putting the question again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale's face showed some conflict of emotions, and he evidently\\r\\nconsidered the matter for almost a minute before answering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've nothing further to add,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll put it plainly, so that there can be no mistake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\nemphasised. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you give us any account of your movements on the\\r\\nnight that your maid was murdered at Heatherfield?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale tightened his lips and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've no information to give you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may as well tell you, Dr. Silverdale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Flamborough warningly,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat we have a certain amount of information drawn from other\\r\\nsources. We may know more than you think. Wouldn't it be best to be\\r\\nfrank with us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale shook his head definitely without making any vocal reply.\\r\\nFlamborough concealed his disappointment, though his face grew darker.\\r\\nHe put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and drew out something.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you recognise that, Dr. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale examined it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that's a cigarette-holder of mine. I recognise it by the fly in\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen did you discover that you had lost it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale was obviously at a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't tell you. Ten days ago or so, I should think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it before or after the murder of your maid that you missed it?\\r\\nThink carefully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't note it down in a\\r\\ndiary or anything of that sort, of course. I use two or three holders.\\r\\nI leave them in the pockets of different suits. Naturally if one of\\r\\nthem goes a-missing, I simply use one of the others; and perhaps the\\r\\nmissing one may turn up later. I can't give you any exact date when\\r\\nthis one went astray.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough returned the holder to his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou play the banjo, don't you, Dr. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale seemed completely astounded by this question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI used to do so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I haven't played for quite a long\\r\\ntime. The banjo isn't much in request nowadays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you bought strings for your instrument recently?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I haven't. Last time I used it, two of the strings snapped, and I\\r\\nnever troubled to replace them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough said, as though attaching no great importance\\r\\nto the point. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow there's another thing I'd like to ask about. I\\r\\nthink that's your laboratory coat hanging on the peg over there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale glanced across the room and nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen did you wear that coat last?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale answered, after a slight hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean you took it off when you left the Institute to go out to\\r\\ndinner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. This morning I've been up at the Research Station, so I've had\\r\\nno occasion to change my jacket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough crossed the room, took down the coat, and spread it out on\\r\\nthe table once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you explain this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he questioned, putting his hand on the tear.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale stared at the rent in the cloth with dismay gathering on\\r\\nhis face. He looked like a man who finds himself surrounded by enemies\\r\\nin unknown strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't account for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said curtly, with whitened lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr for this blood-stain on it, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough demanded,\\r\\nputting his finger on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale's discomposure became even more obvious. It was clear that\\r\\nhe felt himself in a most dangerous position; and his denials betrayed\\r\\nhis nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've no idea how it came there. I noticed nothing of the sort when I\\r\\ntook the coat off last night. Neither the tear nor that stain. I can't\\r\\naccount for it at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're sure you can't?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can't,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silverdale repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to the Inspector's annoyance, Markfield broke into the\\r\\ninterrogation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy are you so sure that Dr. Silverdale has anything to do with the\\r\\nmatter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he interjected in a sardonic tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's not impossible that\\r\\nsomeone borrowed his jacket last night after he'd gone. Several of us\\r\\nwere on the premises after he left, I know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, glancing up, surprised an expression on Sir Clinton's\\r\\nface which indicated that his opinion of Markfield had risen on\\r\\naccount of this interposition; and the Inspector felt his irritation\\r\\nagainst Markfield increasing once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not asking for your assistance now, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed\\r\\nout, chillingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to know what Dr. Silverdale knows about the\\r\\nmatter. You can hardly speak as an authority on that point, can you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield made no reply; but his smile was a comment in itself and did\\r\\nnothing to soothe the Inspector's ruffled feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll have to take this coat, Dr. Silverdale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough explained\\r\\nin an official tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's a piece of evidence which we must have in\\r\\nour charge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as an afterthought, he added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man Whalley has been murdered. The case didn't get into the morning\\r\\nnewspapers. You'll see it in the evening news.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice took on a sub-tinge of warning:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you think the better of your attitude, you'd be well advised to\\r\\ncome to us at once and tell us what you can. It's hardly necessary to\\r\\ntell you that your silence on these points is bound to raise\\r\\nsuspicions; and if you can clear things up, you may save yourself a\\r\\ngood deal of trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed to take a cynical pleasure in destroying the\\r\\nInspector's effects. Instead of leaving him the last word, he closed\\r\\nthe interview himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey used to say a man was innocent until he was proved guilty,\\r\\nInspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he remarked ironically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I see you've interchanged the\\r\\nadjectives nowadays. It must save a lot of trouble to the police.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XV\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's Double\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after the interview with Markfield and his colleague at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute, Inspector Flamborough came into Sir\\r\\nClinton's office, obviously in a state of faint trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've arrested Silverdale this morning, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced in a voice\\r\\nwhich betrayed that he was not quite sure whether this step would meet\\r\\nhis superior's approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable exhibited neither surprise nor disapproval at the\\r\\nnews.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shouldn't care to say that you've got a complete case against him,\\r\\nInspector. Not yet, at any rate. But he's got himself to thank for his\\r\\ntroubles; and now I expect things will begin to move a bit quicker in\\r\\nthe case. Mr. Justice will be calling up his last reserves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough seemed to feel that his action needed some justification,\\r\\nthough Sir Clinton had asked for none.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, it seems to me we had to forestall a possible bolt on\\r\\nSilverdale's part. There's quite enough evidence to justify his\\r\\ndetention on suspicion in the meantime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's just one point I'd like to know about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said,\\r\\ndisregarding the Inspector's statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've got four deaths to\\r\\nchoose from. Which of them are you going to select as your main case?\\r\\nYou can hardly put him on trial for all four simultaneously. There's\\r\\nnothing against it legally, but you'd confuse the jury, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought the bungalow business would be best, sir. There's a fair\\r\\nchance of establishing a motive in it; whereas in the Heatherfield\\r\\naffair there's only conjecture as to what he was after; and in the\\r\\nWhalley case we simply haven't got enough evidence apart from the\\r\\njacket, unless we can prove that Silverdale was the bungalow murderer.\\r\\nAnd if we can prove that, then there's no need to enter into the\\r\\nWhalley case at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton acquiesced with a nod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bungalow affair is the key to the whole series,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted\\r\\nwithout qualification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a knock at the door and a constable entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA young lady wants to see you, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced as he crossed the\\r\\nroom and handed a card to the Chief Constable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe insisted that she\\r\\nmust see you personally. There's a woman with her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend her up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton ordered, after a glance at the card.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the constable had left the room, Sir Clinton flicked the tiny\\r\\noblong of pasteboard across his desk to the Inspector who picked it\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Avice Deepcar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the deuce can she be wanting\\r\\nhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCalm yourself, Inspector. The next instalment will be published in a\\r\\nmoment or two. You'd better wait here while she interviews me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Avice Deepcar entered the office, Flamborough was puzzled by her\\r\\nmanner. She seemed to be agitated, but it was not the sort of\\r\\nagitation he had expected. When she spoke, it sounded as if she were\\r\\nboth indignant and perturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou're Sir Clinton Driffield, aren't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded, scanning the\\r\\nChief Constable closely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable confessed to his identity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I'll come straight to the point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the\\r\\nmeaning of your visiting my house last night, terrorising my maid, and\\r\\nmaking a search through my private papers? I'm going to see my\\r\\nsolicitor about it\\xe2\\x80\\x94I don't believe it's legal. But in the meantime, I\\r\\nwant to know why you did it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough was completely taken aback by this charge. He stared\\r\\nopen-mouthed at his superior. Sir Clinton occasionally did things\\r\\nwhich mystified him; but this seemed something completely out of the\\r\\ncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must have got a search-warrant without saying anything about it to\\r\\nme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector reflected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why on earth didn't he take me with\\r\\nhim, even if he wanted to go through her papers personally?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's face had become an inscrutable mask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you wouldn't mind being a little more explicit, Miss\\r\\nDeepcar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not quite sure that I understand your\\r\\ngrievance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice Deepcar's face showed that she had nothing but contempt for this\\r\\napparent quibbling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you think it worth while, I'll give you details,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\ndisdainfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you're not thinking of denying it, are you? I've\\r\\ngot a witness to prove the facts, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a gesture, Sir Clinton invited her to tell her story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've been away from home for a day or two,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis\\r\\nmorning, I came back to Westerhaven by the eleven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock train and\\r\\ndrove to my house in a taxi. I left my maid alone in the house while I\\r\\nwas away; and when I got home again, I found her in a great state of\\r\\nexcitement. It seems that last night you came to the door, showed her\\r\\nyour card, and told her that you had come to search the house on some\\r\\nmatter connected with these awful murders. Naturally she was greatly\\r\\nshocked; but there was nothing for it but to let you in. You went over\\r\\nthe whole place, searched in every corner of the house, opened every\\r\\ndrawer, poked your nose into all my private possessions\\xe2\\x80\\x94in fact, you\\r\\nbehaved as if I were a criminal under suspicion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, as though to rein in her temper after this sudden\\r\\noutpouring. Indignation had brought a slight flush to her cheeks, and\\r\\nher quickened breathing betrayed the agitation she was trying to keep\\r\\nunder control. Mechanically she changed the position of her feet and\\r\\nsmoothed down her skirt; and Flamborough's sharp eye noted a trembling\\r\\nin her hand as she did so. Sir Clinton maintained his silence and\\r\\ngazed at her as though he expected further information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy maid was very much put about, naturally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe asked\\r\\nyou again and again what was at the back of it all; but you gave her\\r\\nno explanation whatever. When you'd completed your search of my house,\\r\\nyou sat down with a pile of correspondence you'd collected\\xe2\\x80\\x94you see I\\r\\nknow all about it\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you began to read through my private letters.\\r\\nSome of them you put aside; others you laid down in a pile on my desk.\\r\\nWhen you'd finished reading them all, you took away the ones you'd\\r\\nselected and left the rest on the desk. Then you left the house,\\r\\nwithout offering the slightest explanation of this raid of yours. I\\r\\nshan't stand that, you know. You've no right to do things of that\\r\\nsort\\xe2\\x80\\x94throwing suspicion on me in this way, without the faintest ground\\r\\nfor it. Naturally, my maid has been babbling about it and everyone\\r\\nknows the police have been on the premises. It's put me in a dreadful\\r\\nposition; and you'll have to give me an explanation and an apology.\\r\\nIt's no use trying to deny the facts, you know. I can prove what I've\\r\\nsaid. And I want my letters back at once\\xe2\\x80\\x94the ones you stole. . . .\\r\\nYou've no right to them, and I simply won't put up with this kind of\\r\\nthing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe broke off once more, evidently afraid that she was letting her\\r\\nfeelings get the better of her. For a moment or two Sir Clinton made\\r\\nno reply. He seemed to be considering something carefully before he\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you know, Miss Deepcar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Dr.\\r\\nSilverdale is under arrest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl's expression changed in an instant. Something like fear\\r\\nreplaced her earlier anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Silverdale? Arrested?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded, with a tremor in her voice.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was arrested yesterday in connection with the affair at the\\r\\nbungalow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice Deepcar's eyes showed her amazement at the news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe affair at the bungalow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut he had nothing to do\\r\\nwith that! He couldn't have had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll her indignation seemed to have been swept away by this fresh\\r\\ninformation. She had the appearance of someone upon whom a wholly\\r\\nunexpected peril has descended. Sir Clinton seemed satisfied by the\\r\\neffect of his words; but without giving her time for thought, he\\r\\npursued his narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeveral things have turned up which seem to implicate him in that\\r\\naffair, and when we tried to extract some information from him about\\r\\nhis movements on the night of the bungalow murder, he refused to say\\r\\nanything. He wouldn't tell us where he had been at that time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice Deepcar clasped and unclasped her hands mechanically for a\\r\\nsecond or two. It was obvious that she was thinking swiftly and coming\\r\\nto some decision upon which much might turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe won't say where he was?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she demanded in a trembling voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\nnot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton made a vague gesture with his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can hardly tell you his motive. Perhaps he hasn't an alibi. I've\\r\\ntold you what we know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked keenly at the girl before him, evidently expecting\\r\\nsomething; and he was not disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can tell you where he was at that time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice said at last.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProbably you won't believe me, but this is true, at any rate. He and\\r\\nI dined together in town that evening and after dinner we went home to\\r\\nmy house. We had a lot to talk over. We reached my house about\\r\\nhalf-past eight. And then we began to talk things over. We had such a\\r\\nlot to discuss that the time passed without our noticing it; and when\\r\\nat last he got up to go, it was between one and two in the morning. So\\r\\nyou see he couldn't possibly have been at the bungalow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton interjected a question:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy didn't Dr. Silverdale tell us all this frankly when he was\\r\\nquestioned about his movements during that night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice Deepcar flushed at the direct attack, but she evidently had made\\r\\nup her mind to make a clean breast of the whole business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you that Dr. Silverdale was with me that night from\\r\\ndinner-time until the early hours of the morning. As it happened, my\\r\\nmaid was away that day and did not return until the next afternoon.\\r\\nYou must have a pretty good idea of what people would have said about\\r\\nme if they got to know I'd been alone with Dr. Silverdale in my house.\\r\\nI shouldn't have cared, really; because there was nothing in it. We\\r\\nwere simply talking. But I expect that when you questioned him he\\r\\nthought of my position. He's a married man\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least he was a married\\r\\nman then\\xe2\\x80\\x94and some people would have twisted the whole business into\\r\\nsomething very unpleasant for me, I'm sure. So I think, knowing him\\r\\nwell, that he very likely didn't want to give me away. He knew he'd\\r\\nhad nothing to do with the murders, and I expect he imagined that the\\r\\nreal murderer would be detected without his having to give any precise\\r\\naccount of his doings on that night. If I'd known that he was running\\r\\nthe risk of arrest, of course, I'd have insisted on his telling what\\r\\nreally happened; but I've been out of town and I'd no idea things had\\r\\ngot to this pitch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough intervened as she paused for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour maid was away that night? Then you've got no one else who could\\r\\ngive evidence that Dr. Silverdale was with you during that crucial\\r\\nperiod?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice seemed to see a fresh gulf opening before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she admitted, with a faint tremor in her voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were quite\\r\\nalone. No one saw us go into the house and no one saw him leave it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Flamborough. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen it rests on your own evidence entirely?\\r\\nThere's no confirmation of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat confirmation do you need?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice demanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Silverdale will\\r\\ntell you the same story. Surely that's sufficient?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Flamborough could make any comment on this, Sir Clinton turned\\r\\nthe interview back to its original subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to be clear about the other matter first, if you\\r\\nplease, Miss Deepcar. With regard to this police raid on your house,\\r\\nas you called it, can you tell me something more about it? For\\r\\ninstance, you say that I produced my card. Was that card preserved?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy maid tells me that you only showed it to\\r\\nher; you didn't actually hand it over to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen anybody might have presented it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice contradicted him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy maid recognised you. She'd seen your\\r\\nphotograph in a newspaper once, some months ago, and she knew you from\\r\\nthat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Indeed! Can you produce this maid? She's not out of town at\\r\\npresent or anything like that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can produce her in a few moments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice retorted with obvious\\r\\nassurance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe's waiting for me somewhere in this building at the\\r\\npresent time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton glanced at Flamborough and the Inspector retired from the\\r\\nroom. In a very short time he returned, bringing with him a\\r\\nmiddle-aged woman, who glanced inquisitively at Sir Clinton as she\\r\\nentered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Marple,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avice Deepcar demanded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you recognise anyone here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Marple had no hesitation in the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's Sir Clinton Driffield, Miss. I know his face quite well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's suspicion that his superior had been moving in the\\r\\nbackground of the case were completely confirmed by this evidence; but\\r\\nhe was still further surprised to catch a gleam of sardonic amusement\\r\\npassing across the face of the Chief Constable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou recognise me, it seems?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, as though half in doubt as to\\r\\nwhat line to take. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou won't mind my testing your memory a little?\\r\\nWell, then, what kind of suit was I wearing when I came to your\\r\\nhouse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Marple considered carefully for a moment or two before replying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn ordinary suit, sir; a dark one rather like the one you've got on\\r\\njust now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can't recall the colour?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a dark suit, that's all I can remember. You came in the\\r\\nevening, sir, and the light isn't good for colours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou didn't notice my tie, or anything like that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. You'll remember that I was put about at the time. You gave\\r\\nme a shock, coming down on me like that. It's the first time I ever\\r\\nhad to do with the police, sir; and I was all on my nerves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 edge with\\r\\nthe idea that you'd come after Miss Avice, sir. I couldn't hardly get\\r\\nto believe it, and I was all in a twitter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded sympathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm sorry you were so much disturbed. Now have a good look at me\\r\\nwhere the light's bright enough. Do you see anything that strikes you\\r\\nas different from the appearance I had that night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved across to the window and stood patiently while Mrs. Marple\\r\\nscanned him up and down deliberately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou haven't got your eyeglass on to-day, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Did you say eyeglass or eyeglasses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEyeglass, sir. I remember you dropped it out of your eye when you\\r\\nbegan to read Miss Avice's letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cApart from the eyeglass, then, I'm much the same?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've got quit of your cold now, sir. You were quite hoarse that\\r\\nnight you came to the house\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if you'd got a touch of sore throat or\\r\\nsomething like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true. I've no cold now. Anything more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Marple subjected him to another prolonged scrutiny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. You're just like you were that night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you recognised me from some newspaper portrait, it seems?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I saw your picture in the evening paper once. It was just a\\r\\nhead-and-shoulders one; but I'd have recognised you from it even if\\r\\nyou hadn't shown me your card.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton reflected for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you remember what was on that card?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Marple consulted her memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sir Clinton Driffield (and some letters after the name),\\r\\nChief Constable.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Then in the left-hand corner was the address:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Police Headquarters, Westerhaven.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton caught Flamborough's eye and they exchanged glances. The\\r\\nInspector had little difficulty in seeing that his first impression\\r\\nhad been wrong. It was not the Chief Constable who had ransacked Avice\\r\\nDeepcar's house.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton took out his card-case and handed a card to Mrs. Marple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn't that card I showed you, was it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Marple scanned the card for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sir. This one reads quite different.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded and took back the card.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that's really all I want to know, Mrs. Marple. Perhaps\\r\\nInspector Flamborough may want to ask you a question or two later on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice Deepcar seemed by no means satisfied at this close to the\\r\\ninterview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's all very fine, Sir Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you seem to think\\r\\nyou've satisfied me. You haven't. You can't invade my house in this\\r\\nway and then pass the whole thing off as if it were part of your\\r\\nroutine. And you can't carry away a pile of my private letters and\\r\\nkeep them without my consent. I insist on having them back. If you\\r\\ndon't, I'll see my solicitor at once about the matter. And may I\\r\\nremind you again that you owe me some apology for your proceedings?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton seemed in no way ruffled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I apologise for anything I've done which may have\\r\\ninconvenienced you, Miss Deepcar. I'm quite sincere in saying that I\\r\\nvery much regret that you should have been worried in this way.\\r\\nNothing that I have done has been meant to throw any suspicion on you,\\r\\nI can assure you. As to the letters, I think your best plan will be to\\r\\nconsult your solicitor as you suggest. Ask him to ring me up at once,\\r\\nand I'll try to settle the matter as soon as we can. I've no wish to\\r\\ncause you any trouble\\xe2\\x80\\x94none whatever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAvice glanced suspiciously from him to the Inspector. It was evident\\r\\nthat this solution did not satisfy her; but obviously she realised\\r\\nthat nothing would be gained by attempting to argue the point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said at last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll go straight to my solicitor now.\\r\\nYou'll hear from him very shortly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton held the door open for her and she passed out of the room,\\r\\nfollowed by Mrs. Marple. After a few seconds, the Chief Constable\\r\\nturned to Flamborough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make of it all, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, that Mrs. Marple seems to me honest enough, but not very\\r\\nbright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded in assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe recognised her visitor from his resemblance to some blurred\\r\\nnewspaper portrait; and she recognised me from my resemblance to her\\r\\nvisitor. That's your idea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks like it. I never saw you wearing a single eyeglass, sir. And\\r\\nit occurs to me that a single eyeglass helps to change the normal\\r\\nexpression of a face owing to the wrinkling that you make in holding\\r\\nit in your eye. Also if it's an unfamiliar thing, one would drop it\\r\\nwhen one began to read documents, so as not to be hampered by it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue. I suppose that satisfies you\\xe2\\x80\\x94along with the faked visiting-card\\r\\nwhich was meant to impress her with the fact that a high official had\\r\\ndescended on her\\xe2\\x80\\x94that I personally wasn't mixed up in the business.\\r\\nI've the best of reasons for knowing that myself, of course, since I\\r\\nknow I was elsewhere at the time. But what do you make of the raid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDocuments were what the man was after, obviously, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems clear enough that he expected to get hold of something\\r\\ncompromising amongst her correspondence. If you ask me, Inspector, Mr.\\r\\nJustice doesn't seem to stick at much in his self-appointed task.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was pretty sure it was some of his work, sir. The Deepcar girl and\\r\\nSilverdale had a common interest in getting Mrs. Silverdale out of the\\r\\nway; there's no doubt about that. And some people are perfect fools in\\r\\nwhat they put down on paper. It's quite on the cards that Mr. Justice\\r\\nthought he might find something useful amongst Silverdale's letters to\\r\\nAvice Deepcar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe evidently found something which he thought worth taking away, at\\r\\nany rate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a notion that once you\\r\\narrested Silverdale, things would begin to move faster. If Mr. Justice\\r\\nhas got hold of any evidence, it'll be in our hands before long, I'm\\r\\nprepared to bet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's saving us some trouble, if there _is_ anything in writing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\nInspector said, with a grin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe would hardly have raided the Deepcar\\r\\nhouse on such a long chance as that; and he's done the job for us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA most useful and altruistic person, evidently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\ncommented ironically. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow what about the rest of the affair,\\r\\nInspector? If you accept Miss Deepcar's evidence, then the bottom's\\r\\nout of your case against Silverdale. He couldn't be with her and at\\r\\nthe bungalow simultaneously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should we accept her evidence at all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough demanded\\r\\ncrossly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had as much interest in getting Mrs. Silverdale out of\\r\\nthe way as Silverdale himself had. Their interests are absolutely at\\r\\none in the affair. It's more than an even chance that she was his\\r\\naccomplice in the business\\xe2\\x80\\x94standing ready with this tale of hers to\\r\\nprove an alibi for him. I don't reckon her statement was worth that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snapped his fingers contemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's something else, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis Mrs. Marple wasn't\\r\\nat the house that night. What evidence is there that Silverdale and\\r\\nthe Deepcar girl ever went home at all after they'd dined down town?\\r\\nThere's no corroboration of that story. Why not assume that the\\r\\nDeepcar girl was an actual accomplice on the spot? She and Silverdale\\r\\nmay have driven out to the bungalow after dinner, and she may have\\r\\nstood at the window during the whole affair. There's nothing against\\r\\nthat, if you discount her story. My reading of the Deepcar girl is\\r\\nthat she may be surface-shy, so to speak, but she's got good strong\\r\\nfibre in her character underneath. Look how she faced up to you not\\r\\nten minutes ago. Not much shyness about that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I'd have been a bit stirred up myself, Inspector, if you came\\r\\nalong in my absence and pawed over all my private possessions. One\\r\\nisn't necessarily a scoundrel if one turns peevish over a thing of\\r\\nthat sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector let the point pass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any notion who this Mr. Justice can be, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've a pretty fair notion, but it's only a notion. Who stands to\\r\\nprofit by the affair?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome recollection seemed to cross the Inspector's mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpratton, of course, sir. And now I come to think of it, if you\\r\\nshaved off your moustache, he's very like you in face and build. If\\r\\nSpratton's going to collect his insurance on young Hassendean, then\\r\\nmurder's got to be proved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Clinton lightly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI trust Mr. Spratton will get what\\r\\nhe deserves in the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten Evidence\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough had to wait a couple of days before his unknown\\r\\nally, Justice, made any further move. It so happened that Sir Clinton\\r\\nwas not at headquarters when the post brought the expected\\r\\ncommunication; and the Inspector had plenty of time to consider the\\r\\nfresh evidence, unbiased by his superior's comments. As soon as the\\r\\nChief Constable reappeared, Flamborough went to him to display the\\r\\nlatest document in the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis came by the midday post, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained, laying some papers\\r\\non the table. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's Mr. Justice again. The results of his raid on the\\r\\nDeepcar house, it seems.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton picked up the packet and opened out the papers. Some\\r\\nphotographic prints attracted his attention, but he laid them aside\\r\\nand turned first to a plain sheet of paper on which the now familiar\\r\\nletters from telegraph forms had been gummed. With some deliberation\\r\\nhe read the message.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI enclose photographs of part of the correspondence which has\\r\\n  recently taken place between Dr. Silverdale and Miss Deepcar.\\r\\n                                            \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton gazed at the sheet for a moment or two, as though\\r\\nconsidering some matter unconnected with the message. At last he\\r\\nturned to the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you've tried this thing for finger-prints? No good, eh? I\\r\\ncan still smell a faint whiff of rubber from it\\xe2\\x80\\x94off his gloves, I\\r\\nsuppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough shook his head in agreement with Sir Clinton's surmise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing on it whatever, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable laid down the sheet of paper and took up one of\\r\\nthe photographs. It was of ordinary half-plate size and showed a\\r\\nslightly reduced copy of one page of a letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  that things cannot go on any\\r\\n  longer in this way.\\r\\n     The plan we talked over last\\r\\n  seems the best. When I have given\\r\\n  Hassendean hints about the use of\\r\\n  hyoscine, he will probably see for\\r\\n  himself how to get what he wants.\\r\\n  After that, it merely means watching\\r\\n  them, and I am sure that we shall soon\\r\\n  have her out of our way. It will be\\r\\n  very easy to make it seem intentional\\r\\n  on their part; and no one is likely\\r\\n  to look further than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough watched the Chief Constable's face as he read the message,\\r\\nand as soon as he saw that Sir Clinton had completed his perusal of\\r\\nit, the Inspector put in his word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've checked the writing, sir. It's Silverdale's beyond any doubt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable nodded rather absent-mindedly and took up another\\r\\nof the prints. This showed a largely-magnified reproduction of the\\r\\nfirst two lines of the document; and for a minute or so Sir Clinton\\r\\nsubjected the print to a minute scrutiny with a magnifying glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's an original, right enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough ventured to comment at\\r\\nlast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Justice has been very thorough, and he's given us quite\\r\\nenough to prove that it isn't a forgery. You can see there's no sign\\r\\nof erasing or scraping of any sort on the paper of the original; and\\r\\nthe magnification's big enough to show up anything of that sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so far as one can see, the\\r\\nlines of the writing are normal. There are none of those\\r\\nhalts-in-the-wrong-place that a forger makes if he traces a\\r\\nmanuscript. The magnification's quite big enough to show up anything\\r\\nof that sort. I guess you're right, Inspector, it's a photograph of\\r\\npart of a real document in Silverdale's own handwriting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe rest of the things make that clear enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough said,\\r\\nindicating several other prints which showed microphotographic\\r\\nreproductions of a number of other details of the document. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's\\r\\nno doubt whatever that these are all genuine bits of Silverdale's\\r\\nhandwriting. There's been no faking of the paper or anything like\\r\\nthat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton continued his study of the photographs, evidently with\\r\\nkeen interest; but at last he put all the prints on his desk and\\r\\nturned to the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, what do you make of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems clear enough to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at the\\r\\ncontents of that page as a whole. It's as plain as one could wish.\\r\\nSilverdale and the Deepcar girl have had enough of waiting. Things\\r\\ncan't go on any longer in this way. They've been discussing various\\r\\nways of getting rid of Mrs. Silverdale. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The plan we talked over last\\r\\nseems the best.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That's the final decision, evidently. Then you get a\\r\\nnotion of what the plan was. Silverdale was going to prime Hassendean\\r\\nwith information about hyoscine, and practically egg him on to drug\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale so as to get her into his power. Then when the trap\\r\\nwas ready, Silverdale and the Deepcar girl were to be on the alert to\\r\\ntake advantage of the situation. And the last sentence makes it clear\\r\\nenough that they meant to go the length of murder and cover it up by\\r\\nmaking it look like a suicide-pact between young Hassendean and Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale. That's how I read it, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton did not immediately endorse this opinion. Instead, he\\r\\npicked up the full copy of the manuscript page and studied it afresh\\r\\nas though searching for something in particular. At last he appeared\\r\\nto be satisfied; and he slid the photograph across the desk to the\\r\\nInspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't wish to bias you, Inspector, so I won't describe what I see\\r\\nmyself. But will you examine the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98probably\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in that text and tell\\r\\nme if anything whatever about it strikes you as peculiar\\xe2\\x80\\x94anything\\r\\nwhatever, remember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough studied the place indicated, first with his naked eye and\\r\\nthen with the magnifying glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere's no sign of any tampering with the paper that I can see, sir.\\r\\nThe surface is intact and the ink lines run absolutely freely, without\\r\\nthe halts and shakes one would expect in a forgery. The only thing I\\r\\ndo notice is that the word looks just a trifle cramped.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's what I wanted. Note that it's in the middle of a line,\\r\\nInspector. Now look at the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98shall\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the fifth line from the\\r\\nbottom of the page.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne might say it was a trifle cramped too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the third line from the foot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks like the same thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough relapsed into silence and studied the photograph word by\\r\\nword while Sir Clinton waited patiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe word \\xe2\\x80\\x98the\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x98about the use of hyoscine\\xe2\\x80\\x99 seems\\r\\ncramped too; and the \\xe2\\x80\\x98to\\xe2\\x80\\x99 at the start of the last line suffers in the\\r\\nsame way. It's so slight in all these cases that one wouldn't notice\\r\\nit normally. I didn't see it till you pointed it out. But if you're\\r\\ngoing to suggest that there's been any erasing and writing in fresh\\r\\nwords to fit the blank space, I'll have to disagree with you, sir. I\\r\\nsimply don't believe there's been any thing of the sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shan't differ from you over that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton assured him blandly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow let's think of something else for a change. Did it never occur to\\r\\nyou, Inspector, how much the English language depends on the relative\\r\\npositions of words? If I say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98It struck you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that means something\\r\\nquite different from: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You struck it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And yet each sentence contains\\r\\nexactly the same words.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's plain enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough I never thought\\r\\nof it in that way. And,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added in a dubious tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't see what\\r\\nit's got to do with the case, either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's a pity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton observed with a sympathy which hardly\\r\\nsounded genuine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose we think it over together. Where does one\\r\\nusually cramp words a trifle when one is writing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the end of a line,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut these crampings\\r\\nseem to be all in the middle of the lines of that letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's what seems to me interesting about them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton\\r\\nexplained drily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd somehow it seems to associate itself in my mind\\r\\nwith the fact that Mr. Justice hasn't supplied us with the original\\r\\ndocument, but has gone to all the trouble of taking photographs of\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wondered at that, myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector confessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems a bit\\r\\nfutile, true enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry a fresh line, Inspector. We learned on fairly good authority that\\r\\nMr. Justice took away a number of letters from Miss Deepcar's house.\\r\\nAnd yet he only sends us a single page out of the lot. If the rest\\r\\nwere important, why doesn't he send them. If they aren't important,\\r\\nwhy did he take them away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe may be holding them up for use later on, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy reading of the business is different. I think this is Mr.\\r\\nJustice's last reserve. He's throwing his last forces into the battle\\r\\nnow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere seems to be something behind all this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted,\\r\\npassing his hand over his hair as though to stimulate his brain by the\\r\\naction, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I can't just fit it all together as you seem to have\\r\\ndone, sir. You can say what you like, but that handwriting's genuine;\\r\\nthe paper's not been tampered with; and I can't see anything wrong\\r\\nwith it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton took pity on the inspector's obvious anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at the phrasing of the whole document, Inspector. If you cared\\r\\nto do so, you could split it up into a set of phrases something after\\r\\nthis style: \\xe2\\x80\\x98that things cannot go on any longer in this way. . . .\\r\\nThe plan we talked over last seems the best. . . . When I have\\r\\ngiven . . . Hassendean . . . hints . . . about the . . . use of . . .\\r\\nhyoscine . . . he will probably see for himself how . . . to get what\\r\\nhe wants. . . . After that, it merely means . . . watching them . . .\\r\\nand I am sure that . . . we shall soon have . . . her . . . out of our\\r\\nway. . . . It will be very easy . . . to make it seem . . .\\r\\nintentional . . . on their part . . . and no one is likely . . . to\\r\\nlook further than that.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Now, Inspector, if you met any one of these\\r\\nphrases by itself, would you infer from it inevitably that a murder\\r\\nwas being planned? \\xe2\\x80\\x98Things cannot go on any longer in this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If\\r\\nyou consider how Mrs. Silverdale was behaving with young Hassendean,\\r\\nit's not astonishing to find a phrase like that in a letter from\\r\\nSilverdale to the girl he was in love with. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The plan we talked over\\r\\nlast seems the best.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It might have been a day's outing together that\\r\\nhe was talking about for all one can tell. \\xe2\\x80\\x98He will probably see for\\r\\nhimself how my wife is playing with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And so forth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that's all very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough put in, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut what about the\\r\\nword \\xe2\\x80\\x98hyoscine?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That's unusual in love-letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Deepcar was working on hyoscine under Silverdale's directions,\\r\\nremember. It's quite possible that he might have mentioned it\\r\\nincidentally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I think I see what you mean, sir. You think that this document\\r\\nthat Mr. Justice has sent us is a patchwork\\xe2\\x80\\x94bits cut out of a lot of\\r\\ndifferent letters and stuck together and then photographed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm suggesting it as a possibility, Inspector. See how it fits the\\r\\nfacts. Here are a set of phrases, each one innocuous in itself, but\\r\\nwith a cumulative effect of suggestion when you string them together\\r\\nas in this document. If the thing is a patchwork, then a number of\\r\\nreal letters must have been used in order to get fragments which would\\r\\nsuit. So Mr. Justice took a fair selection of epistles with him when\\r\\nhe raided Miss Deepcar's house. Further, in snipping out a sentence\\r\\nhere and there from these letters, he sometimes had to include a\\r\\nphrase running on from one line to another in the original letter; but\\r\\nwhen he came to paste his fragments together, the original hiatus at\\r\\nthe end of a line got transferred to the middle of a line in the final\\r\\narrangement made to fit the page of the faked letter. That's what\\r\\nstruck me to begin with. For example, suppose that in the original\\r\\nletter you had the phrase: \\xe2\\x80\\x98he will probably see for himself how\\xe2\\x80\\x99; and\\r\\nthe original line ended with \\xe2\\x80\\x98probably.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That word might be a bit\\r\\ncramped at the end of the line. But in reconstructing the thing,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98probably\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got into the middle of the line, and so you get this\\r\\napparently meaningless cramping of the word when there was space\\r\\nenough for it to be written uncramped under normal conditions. Just\\r\\nthe same with the other cases you spotted for yourself. They represent\\r\\nthe ends of lines in the original letters, although they all occur in\\r\\nthe middle of lines in the fake production.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat sounds just as plausible as you like, sir. But you've got the\\r\\nknack of making things sound plausible. You're not pulling my leg, are\\r\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Inspector demanded suspiciously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, what about there\\r\\nbeing no sign of the paper having been tampered with?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at what he's given us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton suggested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only case\\r\\nwhere he's given a large-scale reproduction of a whole phrase is at\\r\\nthe top of the letter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Things cannot go on any longer in this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nThat's been complete in the original, and he gives you a large-scale\\r\\ncopy of it showing that the texture of the paper is intact. Of course\\r\\nit is, since he cut the whole bit out of the letter _en bloc_. When it\\r\\ncomes to the microphotographs, of course he only shows you small bits\\r\\nof the words and so there's no sign of the cutting that was needed at\\r\\nthe end of each fragment. And in the photograph of the full text,\\r\\nthere's no attempt to show you fine details. He simply pasted the\\r\\nfragments in their proper order on to a real sheet of note-paper,\\r\\nfilled up the joins with Chinese White to hide the solutions of\\r\\ncontinuity, and used a process plate which wouldn't show the slight\\r\\ndifferences in the shades of the whites where the Chinese White\\r\\noverlay the white of the note-paper. If you have a drawing to make for\\r\\nblack-and-white reproduction in a book, you can mess about with\\r\\nChinese White as much as you like, and it won't show up in the final\\r\\nresult at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, with a gesture, admitted the plausibility of Sir\\r\\nClinton's hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you think that explains why he didn't send us the original\\r\\ndocument, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince I'm sure he hadn't an original to send, it's hard to see how he\\r\\ncould have sent it, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough did not contest this reading of the case. Instead, he\\r\\npassed to a fresh aspect of the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Justice is evidently ready to go any length to avenge\\r\\nsomebody\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that somebody can hardly have been young Hassendean,\\r\\njudging from what we've heard about his character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton refused the gambit offered by the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Justice is a very able person,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceven though he does\\r\\nmake a mistake now and again, as in this last move.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou said you'd some idea who he was, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough said with an\\r\\ninterrogative note in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Constable showed no desire to be drawn. He glanced rather\\r\\nquizzically at his subordinate for a moment before speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll give you the points which strike me in that connection,\\r\\nInspector; and then you'll be just as well placed as I am myself in\\r\\nthe matter of Mr. Justice. First of all, if you compare the time of\\r\\npublication of the morning newspapers with the time, at which Mr.\\r\\nJustice's telegram was collected from the pillar-box, I think it's\\r\\nfairly evident that he didn't depend on the journalists for his first\\r\\ninformation about the affair. Even the Ivy Lodge news wasn't printed\\r\\nuntil after he had despatched his message.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner showed that he expected a good deal more than this tittle\\r\\nof information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTherefore he must have had some direct information about the bungalow\\r\\nbusiness. Either he was on the spot when the affair occurred, or else\\r\\nhe was told about it almost immediately by someone who was on the\\r\\nspot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdmitted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the inspector confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen he obviously\\xe2\\x80\\x94or is it \\xe2\\x80\\x98she obviously,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x94saw the\\r\\nimportance of hyoscine as a clue as soon as any word about it got into\\r\\nthe newspapers. Immediately, in comes the code advertisement, giving\\r\\nus\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather unnecessarily I think\\xe2\\x80\\x94the tip to inquire at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough's face showed that he felt Sir Clinton was merely\\r\\nrecapitulating very obvious pieces of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen there was the writing on the advertisements which he sent to the\\r\\npapers\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mrs. Silverdale's writing rather neatly forged, if you\\r\\nremember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Inspector, showing by his tone that at this point he\\r\\nwas rather at sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen there was the fact that he managed to choose his time most\\r\\nconveniently for his raid on Miss Deepcar's house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean he made his visit when only the maid was at home, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. I rather admire his forethought all through the business.\\r\\nBut there's more in it than that, if you think it over, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, if your reading's correct, he wanted some of Silverdale's\\r\\nletters to serve as a basis for these photographs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething even more obvious than that, Inspector. Now, with all that\\r\\nevidence in front of you, can't you build up some sort of picture of\\r\\nMr. Justice? You ought to be able to come fairly near it, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody fairly in the swim with the Silverdale crowd, at any rate. I\\r\\ncan see that. And someone who knew the Croft-Thornton by hearsay, at\\r\\nany rate. Is that what you mean, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton betrayed nothing in his expression, though the Inspector\\r\\nscrutinised his face carefully; but he added something which\\r\\nFlamborough had not expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinal points. The date on the fragment of an envelope that I found in\\r\\nthe drawer in Mrs. Silverdale's room was 1925. The date inside that\\r\\nsignet-ring on her finger was 5\\xe2\\x80\\x9311\\xe2\\x80\\x9325. And there was the initial \\xe2\\x80\\x98B\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nengraved alongside the date.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough quite obviously failed to see the relevancy of\\r\\nthese details. His face showed it in the most apparent way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't see what you're getting at there, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said rather\\r\\nshamefacedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese things never struck me; and even now I don't see\\r\\nwhat they've got to do with Mr. Justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he expected to gain anything by this frank confession, he was\\r\\ndisappointed. Sir Clinton had evidently no desire to save his\\r\\nsubordinate the trouble of thinking, and his next remark left\\r\\nFlamborough even deeper in bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver read anything by Dean Swift, Inspector?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI read _Gulliver's Travels_ when I was a kid, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough\\r\\nadmitted, with the air of deprecating any investigation into his\\r\\nliterary tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might read his _Journal to Stella_ some time. But I guess you'd\\r\\nfind it dull. It's a reprint of his letters to Esther Johnson. He\\r\\ncalled her \\xe2\\x80\\x98Stella,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and it's full of queer abbreviations and phrases\\r\\nlike \\xe2\\x80\\x98Night, dear MD. Love Pdfr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It teems with that sort of stuff.\\r\\nCurious to see the human side of a man like Swift, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn love with her, you mean, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it sounds like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton replied cautiously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever,\\r\\nwe needn't worry over Swift. Let's see if we can't do something with\\r\\nthis case, for a change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalf-past five. We may be able to get hold of her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the telephone from his desk and asked for a number while\\r\\nFlamborough waited with interest to hear the result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that the Croft-Thornton Institute?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton demanded at\\r\\nlength. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Clinton Driffield speaking. Can you ask Miss Hailsham to\\r\\ncome to the telephone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pause before he spoke once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Hailsham? I'm sorry to trouble you, but can you tell me if\\r\\nthere's a microphotographic camera in the Institute? I'd like to\\r\\nknow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, all ears, waited for the next bit of the one-sided\\r\\nconversation which was reaching him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have two of them? Then I suppose I might be able to get\\r\\npermission to use one of them, perhaps, if we need it. . . . Thanks,\\r\\nindeed. By the way, I suppose you're just leaving the Institute\\r\\nnow. . . . I thought so. Very lucky I didn't miss you by a minute or\\r\\ntwo. I mustn't detain you. Thanks again. Good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put down the telephone and turned to Flamborough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might ask Miss Morcott to come here, Inspector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, completely puzzled by this move, opened the door of the\\r\\nadjoining room and summoned Sir Clinton's typist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you to telephone for me, Miss Morcott,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable\\r\\nexplained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRing up Dr. Trevor Markfield at his house. When you get\\r\\nthrough, say to his housekeeper: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Miss Hailsham speaking. Please tell\\r\\nDr. Markfield that I wish to see him to-night and that I shall come\\r\\nround to his house at nine o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Don't say any more than that, and\\r\\nget disconnected before there's any chance of explanations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Morcott carried out Sir Clinton's orders carefully and then went\\r\\nback to her typing. As soon as the door closed behind her, the\\r\\nInspector's suppressed curiosity got the better of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't quite understand all that, sir. I suppose you asked about the\\r\\nphotomicrographic affair just to see if these prints could have been\\r\\nmade at the Croft-Thornton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hadn't much doubt on that point. Photomicrographic apparatus isn't\\r\\ncommon among amateur photographers, but it's common enough in\\r\\nscientific institutes. No, I was really killing two birds with one\\r\\nstone: finding out about the micro-camera and making sure that Miss\\r\\nHailsham was leaving the place for the night and wouldn't have a\\r\\nchance to speak to Markfield before she went.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what about her calling on Markfield to-night, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe'll have to do it by proxy, I'm afraid. We'll represent her,\\r\\nhowever inefficiently, Inspector. The point is that I wanted to be\\r\\nsure that Markfield would be at home when we called; and I wished to\\r\\navoid making an appointment in my own name lest it should put him too\\r\\nmuch on his guard. The time's come when we'll have to persuade Dr.\\r\\nMarkfield to be a bit franker than he's been, hitherto. I think I see\\r\\nmy way to getting out of him most of what he knows; and if I can\\r\\nsucceed in that, then we ought to have all the evidence we need.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, as though not very sure about something.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe's been bluffing us all along the line up to the present,\\r\\nInspector. It's a game two can play at; and you'll be good enough to\\r\\nturn a deaf ear occasionally if I'm tempted out of the straight path.\\r\\nAnd whatever happens, don't look over-surprised at anything I may say.\\r\\nIf you can contrive to look thoroughly stupid, it won't do any harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Justice\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before entering the road in which Markfield lived, Sir Clinton\\r\\ndrew up his car; and as he did so, a constable in plain clothes\\r\\nstepped forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Markfield's in his house, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he announced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe came home just\\r\\nbefore dinner-time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded, let in his clutch, and drove round the corner to\\r\\nMarkfield's gate. As he stopped his engine, he glanced at the\\r\\nhouse-front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNote that his garage is built into the house, Inspector,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed\\r\\nout. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat seems of interest, if there's a door from the house direct\\r\\ninto the garage, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked up the short approach and rang the bell. In a few moments\\r\\nthe door was opened by Markfield's housekeeper. Rather to her\\r\\nsurprise, Sir Clinton inquired about the health of her relation whom\\r\\nshe had been nursing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, she's all right again, sir, thank you. I got back yesterday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused a moment as though in doubt, then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not sure if Dr. Markfield is free this evening, sir. He's\\r\\nexpecting a visitor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shan't detain him if his visitor arrives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton assured\\r\\nher, his manner leaving no doubt in her mind as to the advisability of\\r\\nhis own admission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper ushered them into Markfield's sitting-room, where they\\r\\nfound him by the fire, deep in a book. At the sound of Sir Clinton's\\r\\nname he looked up with a glance which betrayed his annoyance at being\\r\\ndisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm rather at a loss to understand this visit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said stiffly, as\\r\\nthey came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton refused to notice the obviously grudging tone of his\\r\\nreception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe merely wish to have a few minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 talk, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexplained pleasantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome information has come into my hands which\\r\\nneeds confirmation, and I think you'll be able to help us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield glanced at the clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm in the middle of an experiment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said gruffly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've got to\\r\\nrun it through, now that it's started. If you're going to be long. I'd\\r\\nbetter bring the things in here and then I can oversee it while I'm\\r\\ntalking to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for permission, he left the room and came back in a\\r\\ncouple of minutes with a tray on which stood some apparatus.\\r\\nFlamborough noticed a conical flask containing some limpid liquid, and\\r\\na stoppered bottle. Markfield clamped a dropping funnel, also\\r\\ncontaining a clear liquid, so that its spout entered the conical\\r\\nflask; and by turning the tap of the funnel slightly, he allowed a\\r\\nlittle of the contents to flow down into the flask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope the smell doesn't trouble you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, in a tone of sour\\r\\napology. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's the triethylamine I'm mixing with the tetranitromethane\\r\\nin the flask. Rather a fishy stink it has.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe arranged the apparatus on the table so that he could reach the tap\\r\\nconveniently without rising from his chair; then, after admitting a\\r\\nlittle more of the liquid from the funnel into the flask, he seated\\r\\nhimself once more and gave Sir Clinton his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you want to know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton refused to be hurried. Putting his hand into his\\r\\nbreast-pocket, he drew out some sheets of typewriting which he placed\\r\\non the table before him, as though for future reference. Then he\\r\\nturned to his host.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome time ago, a man Peter Whalley came to us and made a statement,\\r\\nDr. Markfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face betrayed some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhalley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you mean the man who was murdered on the\\r\\nLizardbridge Road?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was murdered, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton confirmed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut as I said,\\r\\nhe made a statement to us. I'm not very clear about some points, and I\\r\\nthink you might be able to fill in one or two of the gaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face showed a quick flash of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm not very sure what you mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, doubtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you're\\r\\ntrying to trap me into saying things that might go against Silverdale,\\r\\nI may as well tell you I've no desire to give evidence against him.\\r\\nI'm sure he's innocent; and I don't wish to say anything to give you a\\r\\nhandle against him. That's frank enough, isn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it relieves your mind, I may as well say I agree with you on that\\r\\npoint, Dr. Markfield. So there's no reason why you shouldn't give us\\r\\nyour help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed slightly taken aback by this, but he did his best to\\r\\nhide his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton half-opened the paper on the table, then took away his\\r\\nhand as though he needed no notes at the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt appears that on the night of the affair at the bungalow, when Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale met her death, Peter Whalley was walking along the\\r\\nLizardbridge Road, coming towards town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a\\r\\nfoggy night, you remember. He'd just passed the bungalow gate when he\\r\\nnoticed, ahead of him, the headlights of a car standing by the\\r\\nroadside; and he appears to have heard voices.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector listened to this with all his ears. Where had Sir\\r\\nClinton fished up this fresh stock of information, evidently of\\r\\ncrucial importance? Then a recollection of the Chief Constable's\\r\\nwarning flashed through his mind and he schooled his features into a\\r\\nmask of impassivity. A glance at Markfield showed that the chemist,\\r\\nthough outwardly uninterested, was missing no detail of the story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the late Mr. Whalley came up to\\r\\nthe car and found a man and a girl in the front seat. The girl seemed\\r\\nto be in an abnormal state; and Mr. Whalley, from his limited\\r\\nexperience, inferred that she was intoxicated. The man, Whalley\\r\\nthought, had stopped the car to straighten her in the seat and make\\r\\nher look less conspicuous; but as soon as Whalley appeared out of the\\r\\nnight, the man started the car again and drove slowly past him towards\\r\\nthe bungalow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton mechanically smoothed out his papers, glanced at them, and\\r\\nthen continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe police can't always choose their instruments, Dr. Markfield. We\\r\\nhave to take witnesses where we can get them. Frankly, then, the late\\r\\nMr. Whalley was not an admirable character\\xe2\\x80\\x94far from it. He'd come upon\\r\\na man and a girl alone in a car, and the girl was apparently not in a\\r\\nfit state to look after herself. An affair of this sort would bring\\r\\ntwo ideas into Mr. Whalley's mind. Clothing them in vulgar language,\\r\\nthey'd be: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Here's a bit o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fun, my word!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is there in it\\r\\nfor me?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He had a foible for trading on the weaknesses of his\\r\\nfellow-creatures, you understand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield nodded grimly, but made no audible comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe late Mr. Whalley, then, stared after the car; and, to his joy, no\\r\\ndoubt, he saw it turn in at the gate of the bungalow. He guessed the\\r\\nplace was empty, since there hadn't been a light showing in it when he\\r\\npassed it a minute or two before. Not much need to analyse Mr.\\r\\nWhalley's ideas in detail, is there? He made up his mind that a\\r\\nsituation of this sort promised him some fun after his own heart,\\r\\nquite apart from any little financial pickings he might make out of it\\r\\nlater on, if he were lucky. So he made his best pace after the car.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton turned over a page of the notes before him and, glancing\\r\\nat the document, knitted his brows slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe late Mr. Whalley wasn't a perfect witness of course, and I'm\\r\\ninclined to think that at this point I can supply a missing detail in\\r\\nthe story. A second car came on the scene round about this period\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\ncar driving in towards town\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it must have met the car with the man\\r\\nand the girl in it just about this time. But that's not in Mr.\\r\\nWhalley's statement. It's only a surmise of my own, and not really\\r\\nessential.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Flamborough had been growing more and more puzzled as this\\r\\nnarrative unfolded. He could not imagine how the Chief Constable had\\r\\naccumulated all this information. Suddenly the explanation crossed his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLord! He's bluffing! He's trying to persuade Markfield that we know\\r\\nall about it already. These are just inferences of his; and he's put\\r\\nthe double bluff on Markfield by pretending that Whalley's statement\\r\\nwasn't quite full and that he's filling the gap with a guess of his\\r\\nown. What a nerve!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commented to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the time the late Mr. Whalley reached the bungalow gate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir\\r\\nClinton pursued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe man had got the girl out of the car and both of\\r\\nthem had gone into the house. Mr. Whalley, it seems, went gingerly up\\r\\nthe approach, and, as he did so, a light went on in one of the front\\r\\nrooms of the bungalow. The curtains were drawn. The late Mr. Whalley,\\r\\nwith an eye to future profit, took the precaution of noting the number\\r\\nof the motor, which was standing at the front door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough glanced at Markfield to see what effect Sir Clinton was\\r\\nproducing. To his surprise, the chemist seemed in no way perturbed.\\r\\nWith a gesture as though asking permission, he leaned over and ran a\\r\\nlittle of the liquid from the funnel into the flask, shook the mixture\\r\\ngently for a moment or two, and then turned back to Sir Clinton. The\\r\\nInspector, watching keenly, could see no tremor in his hand as he\\r\\ncarried out the operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe late Mr. Whalley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton continued, when Markfield had\\r\\nfinished his work. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe late Mr. Whalley did not care about hanging\\r\\nround the front of the bungalow. If he stood in front of the lighted\\r\\nwindow, anyone passing on the road would be able to see him outlined\\r\\nagainst the glare; and that might have led to difficulties. So he\\r\\npassed round to the second window of the same room, which looked out\\r\\non the side of the bungalow and was therefore not so conspicuous from\\r\\nthe road. Just as he turned the corner of the building, he heard a\\r\\nsecond car stop at the gate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton paused here, as though undecided about the next part of\\r\\nhis narrative. He glanced at Markfield, apparently to see whether he\\r\\nwas paying attention; then he proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe late Mr. Whalley tip-toed along to this side-window of the\\r\\nlighted room, and, much to his delight, I've no doubt, he found that\\r\\nthe curtains had been carelessly drawn, so that a chink was left\\r\\nbetween them through which he could peep into the room. He stepped on\\r\\nto the flower-bed, bent down, and peered through the aperture. I hope\\r\\nI make myself clear, Dr. Markfield?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Markfield curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded in acknowledgment, glanced once more at his papers\\r\\nas though to refresh his memory, and continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat he saw was this. The girl was lying in an arm-chair near the\\r\\nfireplace. The late Mr. Whalley, again misled by his limited\\r\\nexperience, thought she'd fallen asleep\\xe2\\x80\\x94the effects of alcohol, he\\r\\nsupposed, I believe. The young man who was with her\\xe2\\x80\\x94we may save the\\r\\ntrouble by calling him Hassendean, I think\\xe2\\x80\\x94seemed rather agitated, but\\r\\nnot quite in the way that the late Mr. Whalley had anticipated.\\r\\nHassendean spoke to the girl and got no reply, evidently. He shook her\\r\\ngently, and so on; but he got no response. I think we may cut out the\\r\\ndetails. The net result was that to Mr. Whalley's inexperienced eye,\\r\\nthe girl looked very far gone. Hassendean seemed to be thunderstruck\\r\\nby the situation, which puzzled the late Mr. Whalley considerably at\\r\\nthe time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield, apparently unimpressed, leaned across and ran some more of\\r\\nthe liquid out of his funnel. Flamborough guessed the movement might\\r\\nbe intended to conceal his features from easy observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe next stage in the proceedings took the late Mr. Whalley by\\r\\nsurprise, it seems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeaving the girl where she\\r\\nwas, young Hassendean left the room for a minute or two. When he came\\r\\nback, he had a pistol in his hand. This was not at all what the late\\r\\nMr. Whalley had been expecting. Least of all did he expect to see\\r\\nyoung Hassendean go up to the girl, and shoot her in the head at close\\r\\nquarters. I'm sure you'll appreciate the feelings of the late Mr.\\r\\nWhalley at this stage, Dr. Markfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurprising,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield commented abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton nodded in agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat must have been even more surprising was the sequel. The glass of\\r\\nthe front window broke with a blow, and from behind the curtains a man\\r\\nappeared, who fell upon Hassendean. There was a struggle, a couple of\\r\\nshots from Hassendean's pistol, and then Hassendean fell on the\\r\\nground\\xe2\\x80\\x94dead, as Whalley supposed at the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough stared hard at Markfield, but at that moment the chemist\\r\\nagain turned in his chair, ran the remainder of the liquid from the\\r\\nfunnel into his flask, and then refilled the funnel from the bottle on\\r\\nthe tray. This done, he turned once more with an impassive face to Sir\\r\\nClinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy this time, the late Mr. Whalley seems to have seen all that he\\r\\nwanted. Just as he was turning away from the window, he noticed the\\r\\nnew-comer take some small object from his waistcoat pocket and drop it\\r\\non the floor. Then Mr. Whalley felt it was time to make himself\\r\\nscarce. He stepped back on to the path, made his way round the\\r\\nbungalow, hurried down the approach to the gate. There he came across\\r\\na car\\xe2\\x80\\x94evidently the one in which the assailant had arrived. The late\\r\\nMr. Whalley, even at this stage, was not quite free from his second\\r\\nidea: \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is there in it for me?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He took the number of the car, and\\r\\nthen he made himself scarce.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton stopped for a moment or two and gazed across at Markfield\\r\\nwith an inscrutable face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added in a casual tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat was the\\r\\npet name that Mrs. Silverdale used to call you when you were alone\\r\\ntogether\\xe2\\x80\\x94the one beginning with \\xe2\\x80\\x98B\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time, it was evident to the Inspector, Sir Clinton had got home\\r\\nunder Markfield's guard. The chemist glanced up with more than a shade\\r\\nof apprehension on his face. He seemed to be making a mental estimate\\r\\nof the situation before he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cH'm! You know that, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said finally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen there's no use\\r\\ndenying it, I suppose. She used to call me \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bear\\xe2\\x80\\x99 usually. She said I\\r\\nhad the manners of one, at times; and perhaps there was something in\\r\\nthat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton showed no sign that he attached much importance to\\r\\nMarkfield's explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou became intimate with her some time in 1925, I think, just after\\r\\nthe Silverdales came here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield nodded his assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd very shortly after that, you and she thought it best to conceal\\r\\nyour liaison by seeing as little of each other as possible in public,\\r\\nso as not to draw attention to your relations?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's true.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd finally she got hold of young Hassendean to serve as a blind?\\r\\nAdvertised herself with him openly, whilst you stayed in the\\r\\nbackground?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to know a good deal about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield admitted coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I know all that matters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Chief Constable commented.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've lost the game, Dr. Markfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield seemed to consider the situation rapidly before he spoke\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can't make it worse than manslaughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's no\\r\\nmore than that, on the evidence you've given me just now. I saw him\\r\\nshoot Yvonne, and then, in the struggle afterwards, his pistol went\\r\\noff twice by accident and hit him. You couldn't call that a case of\\r\\nmurder. I shall plead that it was done in self-defence; and you\\r\\nhaven't Whalley to put into the box against me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton took no pains to conceal a sardonic smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt won't do, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might get off on\\r\\nthat plea if it were only the bungalow business that you were charged\\r\\nwith. But there's the murder of the maid at Heatherfield as well. You\\r\\ncan't twist that into a self-defence affair. No jury would look at it\\r\\nfor a moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to know a good deal about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield repeated\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose what you really wanted at Heatherfield was a packet of your\\r\\nlove-letters to Mrs. Silverdale?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield confirmed this with a nod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's all you have against me, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded after a\\r\\npause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere's the affair of the late Mr. Whalley as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's face betrayed neither surprise nor chagrin at this fresh\\r\\ncharge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's all, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he questioned again, with apparent unconcern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll that's of importance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton admitted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, in the\\r\\nguise of our friend Mr. Justice, you did your best to throw suspicion\\r\\non Silverdale. That's a minor point, so far as you're concerned now.\\r\\nIt's curious how you murderers can't leave well alone. If you hadn't\\r\\nplayed the fool there, you'd have given us ever so much more trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield made no answer at the moment. He seemed to be reviewing the\\r\\nwhole situation in his mind, thinking hard before he broke the\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood thing, a scientific training,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at length, rather\\r\\nunexpectedly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt teaches one to realise the bearing of plain facts.\\r\\nMy game seems to be up. You've been too smart for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, and a grim smile crossed his face, as though he found\\r\\nsomething humorous in the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem to have enough stuff there to pitch a tale to a jury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I daresay you've more in reserve. I'm not inclined to\\r\\nbe dragged squalling to the gallows\\xe2\\x80\\x94too undignified for my taste. I'll\\r\\ntell you the facts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough, eager that things should be done in proper form,\\r\\ninterposed the usual official cautionary statement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield answered carelessly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou'll find paper\\r\\nover yonder on my desk, beside the typewriter. You can take down what\\r\\nI say, and I'll sign it afterwards if you think that necessary when\\r\\nI've finished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector crossed the room, picked up a number of sheets of\\r\\ntypewriting paper, and returned to the table. He pulled out his\\r\\nfountain-pen and prepared to take notes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMind if I light my pipe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the chemist put his hand to his pocket, Flamborough half-rose from\\r\\nhis seat; but he sank back again into his chair when a tobacco-pouch\\r\\nappeared instead of the pistol which he had been afraid might be\\r\\nproduced. Markfield threw him a glance which showed he had fathomed\\r\\nthe meaning of the Inspector's start.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't get nervous,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said contemptuously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere'll be no shooting.\\r\\nThis isn't a film, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reached up to the mantelpiece for his pipe, charged it\\r\\ndeliberately, lighted it, and then turned to Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou've got a warrant for my arrest, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked in a tone\\r\\nwhich sounded almost indifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton's affirmative reply did not seem to disturb him. He\\r\\nsettled himself comfortably in his chair and appeared interested\\r\\nchiefly in getting his pipe to burn well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'll speak slowly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last, turning to the Inspector. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I\\r\\ngo too fast, just let me know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough nodded and sat, pen in hand, waiting for the opening of\\r\\nthe narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Connecting Thread\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't see how you did it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Markfield began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you got to the\\r\\nroot of things when you traced a connection between me and Yvonne\\r\\nSilverdale. I'd never expected that. And considering how we'd kept our\\r\\naffairs quiet for years, I thought I'd be safe at the end of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was in 1925, as you said, that the thing began\\xe2\\x80\\x94just after\\r\\nSilverdale came to the Croft-Thornton. There was a sort of amateur\\r\\ndramatic show afoot then, and both Yvonne and I joined it. That\\r\\nbrought us together first. The rest didn't take long. I suppose it was\\r\\na case of the attraction of opposites. One can't explain that sort of\\r\\nthing on any rational basis. It just happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated for a moment, as though casting his mind back to these\\r\\nearlier times; then he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce it _had_ happened, I did the thinking for the pair of us.\\r\\nClearly enough, the thing was to avoid suspicion. That meant that\\r\\npeople mustn't couple our names even casually. And the way to prevent\\r\\nthat was to see as little of each other as possible in public. I\\r\\ndropped out of things, cut dances, left the theatrical affair, and\\r\\nposed as being engrossed in work. She advertised herself as dance-mad.\\r\\nIt suited her well enough. Result: we hardly ever were seen in the\\r\\nsame room. No one thought of linking our names in the remotest way. I\\r\\ngave her no presents. . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThink again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou gave her at least one\\r\\npresent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield reflected for some moments; then his face showed more than a\\r\\ntrace of discomfiture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean a signet-ring? Good Lord! I forgot all about it, that night\\r\\nat the bungalow! So that's where you got your story about the initial\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98B.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from? I never thought of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Clinton made no comment, and after a few seconds Markfield\\r\\ncontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the early days, we wrote letters to each other\\xe2\\x80\\x94just a few. Later\\r\\non, I urged her to burn them, for safety's sake. But she treasured\\r\\nthem, apparently; and she wouldn't do it. She said they were quite\\r\\nsafe in a locked drawer in her bedroom. Silverdale never entered her\\r\\nroom, you know. It seemed safe enough. It was these damned letters\\r\\nthat landed me in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYvonne and I hadn't any reason to worry about Silverdale. He'd lost\\r\\nall interest in her and gone off after Avice Deepcar. Oh, that was all\\r\\nquite respectable and above-board. She's a decent girl\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing against\\r\\nher. We'd have been quite glad to see him marry her, except that it\\r\\nwouldn't have suited our book. My screw was good enough for a single\\r\\nman. It wouldn't have kept two of us\\xe2\\x80\\x94not on the basis we needed,\\r\\nanyhow. And a divorce case might have got me chucked out of the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton. Where would we have been then? So you see that alley\\r\\nwas barred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy and by, young Hassendean turned up. When I found he was getting\\r\\nkeen on Yvonne, I encouraged her to keep him on her string. She had no\\r\\nuse for the boy except as a dancing-partner; but we used him as a\\r\\nblind to cover the real state of affairs. So long as people could talk\\r\\nabout him and her, they weren't likely to think of her and me. So she\\r\\nled him on until the brat thought he was indispensable. I suppose he\\r\\nfell in love with her, in a way. We never imagined he might be\\r\\ndangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was the state of things up to ten days before the affair at the\\r\\nbungalow. There seemed to be no reason why it shouldn't have lasted\\r\\nfor years. But just then Yvonne got news of this money that had been\\r\\nleft her\\xe2\\x80\\x94about \\xc2\\xa312,000. That put a new light on the affair. It gave\\r\\nher an income of her own. We could afford to let Silverdale divorce\\r\\nher; then I could have chucked the Croft-Thornton, married her, and\\r\\nset up in private practice somewhere. Her money would have kept us\\r\\ngoing until I had scraped a business together; and no one cares a damn\\r\\nabout the matrimonial affairs of a chemical expert in private\\r\\npractice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe talked it over, and we practically made up our minds to take that\\r\\ncourse. It seemed a bit too good to be true. Anyhow it would have got\\r\\nus out of all the hole-and-corner business. After three years of that,\\r\\nwe were getting a bit sick of it. Another week or two, and Westerhaven\\r\\nwould have had all the scandal it needed, if it was inclined that way.\\r\\nWe'd have got each other. And Silverdale could have married his girl\\r\\nwith all the sympathy of the town. Ideal, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe puffed savagely at his pipe for a moment or two before speaking\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen that young skunk Hassendean. . . . He must needs get above\\r\\nhimself and ruin the whole scheme, damn him! I can only guess what\\r\\nhappened. He got to know about the properties of hyoscine. There was\\r\\nplenty of it at the Croft-Thornton. He must have stolen some of it and\\r\\nused it to drug Yvonne that night. However, that's going a bit fast.\\r\\nI'll tell you what happened, as it seemed to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield paused and glanced inquiringly at the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt's all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flamborough reassured him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you don't speak\\r\\nquicker than that, I can take it down easily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield leaned over and gave the contents of his flask a gentle\\r\\nshake before continuing his narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat night, I'd been out late at the Research Station on a piece of\\r\\nwork. I mean I'd gone there after dinner for a few minutes. When I\\r\\nfinished, I came in by the Lizardbridge Road in my car. It was a bit\\r\\nfoggy, and I was driving slowly. Just after I'd passed the bungalow, I\\r\\nmet an open car. We were both crawling, owing to the fog; and I had a\\r\\ngood look at the people in the other car. One was young Hassendean.\\r\\nThe other was Yvonne; and even as I passed them, I could see there was\\r\\nsomething queer about the business. Besides, what would she be doing\\r\\nwith that young whelp away out of town? I knew her far too well to\\r\\nthink she was up to any hanky-panky with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looked queer. So as soon as I was past them, I turned my car,\\r\\nmeaning to follow them and stand by. Unfortunately in the fog, I\\r\\nalmost ditched my car in turning; and it gave me some trouble to swing\\r\\nround\\xe2\\x80\\x94one wheel got into the trench at the edge of the road. It was a\\r\\nminute or so before I got clear again. Then I went off after them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw the car at the door of the bungalow, and some lights on in the\\r\\nplace which hadn't been there when I'd passed it on my way down. So I\\r\\nstopped my car at the gate and walked up to the bungalow door. It was\\r\\nlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn't care about hammering on the door. That would only have put\\r\\nHassendean on the alert and left me still on the wrong side of the\\r\\ndoor. So I walked round to the lighted window and managed to get a\\r\\nglimpse of the room through the curtains. Yvonne was lying back in an\\r\\narmchair, facing me. I thought she'd fainted or something like that.\\r\\nThe whole affair puzzled me a bit, you see. That young skunk\\r\\nHassendean was wandering about the room, evidently in a devil of a\\r\\nstate of nerves about something or other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as I was making up my mind to break the window, he bolted out of\\r\\nthe room; and I thought he meant to clear off from the house, leaving\\r\\nYvonne there\\xe2\\x80\\x94ill, perhaps. That made me pretty mad; and I kept my eye\\r\\non the front door to see that he didn't get away without my catching\\r\\nhim. That prevented me from breaking the window and climbing into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, a bit to my surprise, the young swine came back again with\\r\\nsomething in his hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94I couldn't see what it was then. He walked over\\r\\nto where Yvonne was, in the chair, lifted his arm, and shot her in the\\r\\nhead. Deliberately. Nothing like an accident, remember. And there,\\r\\nbefore my eyes, I saw the whole of our dreams collapsing, just when we\\r\\nthought they were going to come true. Pretty stiff, wasn't it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent forward and made a pretence of knocking the ashes from his\\r\\npipe. When he looked up again, his face was set once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm no psychologist to spin you a yarn about how I felt just then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn fact, I doubt if I felt anything except that I\\r\\nwanted to down that young hound. Anyhow, I broke the glass, got my\\r\\nhand inside, undid the catch, and was through the curtain before he\\r\\nknew what was happening. I don't know what he thought when he saw me.\\r\\nHis face was almost worth it\\xe2\\x80\\x94sheer amazement and terror. He was just\\r\\nbringing up his pistol when I dropped on him and got his wrist. Then\\r\\nthere was a bit of a struggle; but he hadn't a chance against me. I\\r\\nshot him twice in the body and when he dropped, with blood coming from\\r\\nhis mouth, I knew I'd got him in the lung, and I didn't bother further\\r\\nabout him. He seemed done for. I hoped he was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's voice in the last few sentences had expressed the\\r\\nbitterness of his emotions; but when he continued, he made a\\r\\nsuccessful effort to keep his tone level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne thinks quick enough in a tight corner. First thing I did was to\\r\\nlook at Yvonne.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders to express what he seemed unable to put into\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat dream was done for. The only thing to do was to clear myself. I\\r\\nhad another look at Hassendean. He seemed to have had his gruel. I'd a\\r\\nnotion of shooting him again, just to make sure, but it didn't seem\\r\\nworth while. Besides, there had been row enough already. A fourth shot\\r\\nmight draw some passer-by. So I left him. I picked up the pistol and\\r\\ncleaned my finger-marks off it before putting it on the floor again.\\r\\nThen I did the same for the window-hasp. These were the only two\\r\\nthings I'd touched, so I wasn't leaving traces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I remembered something. Silverdale was always leaving his\\r\\ncigarette holder lying about the lab. He'd put it down on a bench or a\\r\\ndesk and wander off, leaving the cigarette smouldering. That happened\\r\\ncontinually. That very afternoon, he'd left the thing in my room and\\r\\nI'd pocketed it, meaning to give it back to him when I saw him again.\\r\\nThere it was, in my vest-pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn this world, it's a case of every man for himself. My business was\\r\\nto get out of the hole I was in. If Silverdale got into a hole\\r\\nhimself, it was his affair to get out of it. Besides, he'd probably\\r\\nhave an alibi, whereas I hadn't. In any case, the more tangled the\\r\\nbusiness was, the better chance you fellows had of getting off my\\r\\nscent. If the whole story came out, I didn't see how I was to persuade\\r\\na jury it had been pure self-defence when I knew myself that it wasn't\\r\\nthat really. Besides, there were these infernal love-letters waiting\\r\\nat Yvonne's house, all ready for the police and pointing straight to\\r\\nme as a factor in the affair. I'd have had awkward questions to answer\\r\\nabout the contents of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe net result was that I cleaned Silverdale's cigarette-holder with\\r\\nmy handkerchief to take off any finger-prints; and I dropped it on the\\r\\nfloor to amuse you people. It had that fly in the amber\\xe2\\x80\\x94absolutely\\r\\nunique and easily identifiable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I switched off the lights, got out of the window again, closed\\r\\nit behind me in case it should attract a passer-by. I used my\\r\\nhandkerchief to grip the hasp when I closed it, so as not to leave any\\r\\nfinger-prints there. In fact, as I walked down to my car, I felt I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\r\\ndone remarkably well on the spur of the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I drove in toward Westerhaven, I conned things over; and it struck\\r\\nme I'd be none the worse of seeing someone as soon as I could. My\\r\\nhousekeeper was away nursing a sick relation, so no one could swear\\r\\nwhether I'd been at home in the evening or not. If I could drop in on\\r\\nsomeone, there was always the chance of creating some sort of alibi.\\r\\nThe bother was, I knew I wasn't quite normal. That was only natural.\\r\\nBut if I called on someone who saw me every day, they might spot that\\r\\nI was a bit on edge and that might lead to anything, you know. Then it\\r\\nflashed into my mind that Ringwood had come here lately. I hadn't seen\\r\\nhim for years. He wouldn't see anything funny in my manner, even if I\\r\\nwas a bit abnormal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI drove to his house, and there I had a bit of luck\\xe2\\x80\\x94a perfect gift\\r\\nfrom the gods. From a telephone message he got while I was in the room\\r\\nwith him, I learned that Silverdale was out that night, one of his\\r\\nmaids was in bed, and the maid wanted Ringwood to call at once. One's\\r\\nmind works quickly, as I told you, and I saw in five seconds what a\\r\\nchance I'd got. I offered to pilot Ringwood over to Heatherfield. That\\r\\nmeant I'd a perfectly sound excuse if I was seen in the neighbourhood\\r\\nof the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dropped him at the end of Lauderdale Avenue, as I expect he told\\r\\nyou. During the run, I'd had time to think over things. There was only\\r\\none solution that I could see. I had to get hold of these letters,\\r\\ncost what it might. I calculated that Ringwood's visit wouldn't be a\\r\\nlong one; and as soon as he'd gone, I meant to drop into Heatherfield,\\r\\nsilence the maid, and get the packet of letters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must have run a bigger risk than I intended; for evidently I got\\r\\ninto Heatherfield between Ringwood's visit and yours. Can you wonder I\\r\\nwas a bit pleased with my luck, when it all came out? I made the\\r\\ntourniquet while I was waiting about. Then I went up to Silverdale's\\r\\nhouse, rang the bell, and asked for Silverdale. Of course he wasn't\\r\\nthere; but the maid knew me and let me in to write a note for him.\\r\\nOnce she'd seen my face and recognised me, it was all up with her.\\r\\nOne's own skin comes first. I might have risked it if it hadn't been\\r\\nthat the drawer was locked and I had to burst it open. That meant\\r\\nleaving traces. And, since she knew me, that meant losing the game.\\r\\nSo . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made a gesture as if using the tourniquet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went home after that and destroyed these letters. Then I sat down\\r\\nto do the hardest bit of thinking I've done in my life. Time meant a\\r\\ngood deal to me just then, for I had to have everything cut and dried\\r\\nbefore any questions were asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen the notion of a double game came into my mind. Why not follow up\\r\\nthe cigarette-holder move and do my best to throw discredit on\\r\\nSilverdale. It was up to him to clear himself. That gave me the notion\\r\\nof anonymous letters. And obviously if I wanted any attention paid to\\r\\nthem, I'd have to make a good start. That suggested giving the police\\r\\nthe earliest information about the bungalow affair. If they got that\\r\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x98Justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then they'd pay real attention to anything else he\\r\\nliked to send them. So I hit on the telegram idea as being the safest\\r\\nand the quickest. And, as a sequel to that, the obvious thing was to\\r\\nmake a show in public of being on Silverdale's side, so that you\\r\\nwouldn't suspect me of having any possible connection with the\\r\\nanonymous letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou overdid it just a trifle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton commented in a dry tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield made a non-committal gesture, but did not argue the point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust as I thought I'd fixed everything neatly,\\r\\nthis creature Whalley descended on me. He'd taken the number of my car\\r\\nat the gate and faked up a yarn about an accident, so that he could\\r\\nget me identified for him. He called on me and started blackmail. I\\r\\npaid him, of course, to keep him quiet. But naturally I couldn't let\\r\\nhim stand in my way after all I'd gone through safely. He wasn't a\\r\\nvery valuable life at the best, I gather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, I got him up here one night\\xe2\\x80\\x94my housekeeper was still away\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthrottled him without too much trouble. Then I took the body down into\\r\\nthe garage, put it into my car, and drove out the Lizardbridge Road a\\r\\nbit before tipping him into the ditch. I left the tourniquet beside\\r\\nhis body. It was a specially-contrived one, meant to throw some more\\r\\nsuspicion on Silverdale. I forgot to say that I borrowed Silverdale's\\r\\nlab. coat to wear during the operation, in case of there being any\\r\\nblood. And I tore off a button and left it in Whalley's hand. Then I\\r\\nput the torn jacket back on Silverdale's peg, ready for the police.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNaturally I was quite pleased to hear that Silverdale had been\\r\\narrested. That was his look-out, after all. And he seemed to be in\\r\\ntrouble over an alibi, which was better news still. The next thing was\\r\\nto clinch the business, if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI've told you that once upon a time I played some parts in an amateur\\r\\ndramatic show. I was really not bad. And it struck me, after I'd seen\\r\\nyou once or twice, Sir Clinton, that I could make myself up into a\\r\\nvery fair copy of you. We're about the same height to start with. I\\r\\nwouldn't have risked it with anyone who knew both of us; but I'd\\r\\nlearned that Avice Deepcar was out of town, and I thought I could\\r\\nmanage to take in her maid easily enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I raided her place, posing as Sir Clinton Driffield\\xe2\\x80\\x94I'd had some\\r\\nnotion of the sort in my mind for a while and had cards printed in\\r\\nLondon all ready: one of these print-\\xe2\\x80\\x99em-while-you-wait places which\\r\\nleft no traces behind in the way of an address or an account. In my\\r\\nraid, I got a valuable document.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a clever enough fake, Dr. Markfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Clinton said\\r\\nreflectively. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you left one or two things in it that we took hold\\r\\nof easily enough. By the way, I suppose you simply traced Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's writing from some old letters when you put the faked\\r\\naddress on the code advertisements you sent to the newspapers?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to have missed much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose slowly to his feet and put down his pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that's the whole story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said indifferently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you've\\r\\ngot it all down now, Inspector, I'll sign it and initial it for you.\\r\\nThen I suppose it'll be a case of ringing up the Black Maria or\\r\\nsomething like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at Sir Clinton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wouldn't care to tell me how you worried the thing out, I\\r\\nsuppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Chief Constable bluntly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don't feel inclined to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield made a gesture as though regretting this decision. He drew\\r\\nhis fountain pen from his pocket, unscrewed the cap deliberately, and\\r\\nmoved round the table towards the sheets of paper which the Inspector\\r\\nhad spread out for signature. A thought seemed to occur to him as he\\r\\ndid so, and he bent forward to the apparatus on the tray. His manner\\r\\nwas so unconcerned and the gesture so natural that neither Sir Clinton\\r\\nnor the Inspector thought of interfering before it was too late.\\r\\nMarkfield put his hand on the tap of the funnel, and as he did so, his\\r\\nface lighted up with malicious glee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned the tap, and on the instant the whole house shook under a\\r\\nterrific detonation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nExcerpts from Sir Clinton's Notebook\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the murder at Heatherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . The following things seem suggestive. (1) The break-up of the\\r\\nSilverdale m\\xc3\\xa9nage, with Silverdale turning to Avice Deepcar whilst\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale lets Hassendean frequent her openly. (2) Hassendean's\\r\\ninterference with the usual routine of coffee serving after dinner at\\r\\nHeatherfield. (3) The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdazed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d appearance of Mrs. Silverdale when she\\r\\nleft the house after coffee. (4) The fact that the two shots which\\r\\nwounded Hassendean at close quarters were not fired in Ivy Lodge.\\r\\n(This exonerates Dr. Ringwood, who might otherwise have come under\\r\\nsuspicion). (5) The disappearance of Mrs. Silverdale, who was last\\r\\nseen in Hassendean's company. (6) The words: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaught me . . . Thought\\r\\nit was all right. . . . Never guessed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which Hassendean uttered\\r\\nbefore he died. (7) The murder of the maid at Heatherfield, which was\\r\\nclearly done by someone she knew well or she would not have admitted\\r\\nhim at that time of night. (8) The ransacking of one particular drawer\\r\\nin Mrs. Silverdale's bedroom, suggesting that the murderer had full\\r\\nknowledge of her private affairs. (9) The envelope fragment with the\\r\\ndate-stamp 1925, which might indicate that the drawer had held letters\\r\\ncompromising to the murderer. (10) The old dance programmes on which\\r\\nasterisks stood for the name of some partner, who must have been\\r\\nintimate with her at that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affair can hardly have been the usual social-triangle tragedy:\\r\\nSilverdale surprising his wife with Hassendean. This hypothesis fails\\r\\nto account for (_a_) the dazed appearance of Mrs. Silverdale, which\\r\\nsuggests drugging; (_b_) the murder and burglary at Heatherfield,\\r\\nSilverdale's own house in which he could come and go freely without\\r\\nresorting to such extremes; and (_c_) The expression \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaught\\r\\n_me_ . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Hassendean's last words, since \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaught _us_ . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nwould have been the natural phrase in the case of the triangle-drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious that Dr. Markfield should pilot Ringwood right across the town\\r\\nand then drop him at the end of the avenue instead of going a hundred\\r\\nyards or so further, to the very gate of the house. Worth keeping in\\r\\nmind that Dr. Markfield knew Mrs. Silverdale well at one time, though\\r\\nhe cooled off later (Ringwood's evidence). Compare the old\\r\\ndance-programmes?\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the discovery of the bungalow tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is clearly the second half of the Hassendean business. Obviously\\r\\nHassendean prepared the bungalow beforehand for the reception of Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale. Either she consented to go there willingly; or else, as\\r\\nseems more likely, he drugged her after dinner and took her there\\r\\nwithout her consent. In any case, it was premeditated on his part.\\r\\nEvidently he overshot the dose of the drug and killed her. His\\r\\nsubsequent shooting the body suggests that he meant to leave an\\r\\nobvious cause of death, which might divert attention from the poison\\r\\naltogether and cause it to be overlooked in a P.M. examination. In\\r\\nthat case, it's likely that he meant to take the body elsewhere in his\\r\\ncar and leave it\\xe2\\x80\\x94meaning to suggest that she committed suicide. Of\\r\\ncourse the shooting may have been done accidentally or by a third\\r\\nparty who did not know she was already dead. But this seems unlikely\\r\\non the face of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour people at least were at the bungalow that night: Mrs. Silverdale,\\r\\nHassendean, and the two watchers at the windows. One of the watchers\\r\\nmust be this fellow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who had the first news of the affair.\\r\\nOne of them was probably the murderer of Hassendean, since he entered\\r\\nthe room. The second watcher may have seen the murder committed,\\r\\nthough this is not certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the general state of the bungalow, the only clues of\\r\\ninterest are the cigarette-holder and the signet-ring on Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale's finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale denies that he gave her the ring; and as the date 1925 in\\r\\nit belongs to the period of dissociation in the Silverdale m\\xc3\\xa9nage, it\\r\\nseems probable that he is speaking the truth. The initial \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d engraved\\r\\nin the ring evidently indicates the donor, and it may stand for either\\r\\na real initial or the initial of a pet name. Possibly the donor was\\r\\nthe person indicated by an asterisk on the dance-programmes and (or)\\r\\nthe person who burgled Heatherfield to get hold of letters which\\r\\nperhaps compromised him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cigarette-holder found at the bungalow is undoubtedly\\r\\nSilverdale's, but that does not necessarily prove that Silverdale was\\r\\never there. Someone else, who had a chance of laying hands on his\\r\\ncigarette-holder, may have left it to mislead us. All that it tells is\\r\\nthat someone associated with Silverdale was at the bungalow. Both\\r\\nHassendean and Mrs. Silverdale fit this description.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Silverdale, it's evident that he wanted to get rid of his wife\\r\\nand marry Miss Deepcar. But that does not prove he was prepared to go\\r\\nthe length of murder to gain his ends. He has no alibi for the period\\r\\nof the bungalow affair; but few of us could produce an alibi for a\\r\\ngiven time on the spur of the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hailsham had a grudge against Hassendean, but there is no\\r\\nevidence connecting her with the bungalow affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid at Heatherfield seems a mere pawn in the game. Silverdale\\r\\nmight have used her to drug the coffee; but Hassendean's unusual\\r\\ninterference with the normal serving of the coffee (coupled with his\\r\\npreparations beforehand at the bungalow) point to him as the\\r\\nadministrator of the drug.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the drug, Hassendean must have had easy access to it. It's a\\r\\nmydriatic drug, since the eye-pupils were expanded. Miss Deepcar\\r\\nmentioned hyoscine when she came into the room at the Croft-Thornton\\r\\nInstitute, so that evidently they have it on the premises there.\\r\\nHyoscine narcosis has one special peculiarity: it obliterates from the\\r\\npatient's memory all recollection of what may have happened while the\\r\\ndrug was acting. At least that's what they say about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwilight\\r\\nSleep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d treatment. This would be the very drug Hassendean would require\\r\\nfor his purpose. Mrs. Silverdale would wake up from the narcosis with\\r\\nonly the very faintest recollection of what had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nA preliminary hypothesis seems possible. Hassendean resolved to drug\\r\\nMrs. Silverdale with hyoscine and take her to the bungalow while under\\r\\nthe influence of the narcotic. He prepared the place beforehand and\\r\\ngot her there successfully. But he overshot the dose he gave her, and\\r\\nshe died in his hands at the bungalow. He then shot her in the head,\\r\\nmeaning to take her away in his car and leave the body somewhere,\\r\\narranged as though it were a case of suicide. He might hope that in\\r\\nthese circumstances the drug might not be spotted and thus he would be\\r\\ncompletely clear. But someone else saw the shooting and, being keenly\\r\\ninterested in Mrs. Silverdale, shot Hassendean in revenge. On the face\\r\\nof things, this third party must be either \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the second\\r\\nwatcher. Then, if this third party had been intimate with Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale, there might be letters in her possession which would bring\\r\\nout their relations; and these letters it might be essential to\\r\\nsecure. Hence the murder of the maid and the burglary at Heatherfield.\\r\\nVery sketchy, of course, but it seems suggestive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it be the truth or near it, then the murderer must have known when\\r\\nto strike at Heatherfield, for usually there were two maids on the\\r\\npremises, which would be too big a job for a single assailant. But,\\r\\nfrom Ringwood's evidence, _Markfield learned the state of affairs at\\r\\nHeatherfield that night from the 'phone call which came through when\\r\\nhe was at Ringwood's house_. And at once he offered to pilot Ringwood\\r\\nthrough the fog\\xe2\\x80\\x94which gave him a perfectly sound excuse for being in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood of Heatherfield if anyone happened to recognise him.\\r\\nFurther, he deliberately avoided taking Ringwood up to the\\r\\nHeatherfield gate, but dropped him at the end of Lauderdale Avenue.\\r\\nThis would avoid any chance of his being directly connected with\\r\\nHeatherfield that night; and after he left Ringwood, he could easily\\r\\ndrive round to the back of Heatherfield and watch his chance to enter\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after reading Hassendean's Journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree things emerge from Hassendean's M.S. (1) He seems to have\\r\\nexcited Miss Hailsham to the extent of a loss of control when he\\r\\njilted her; but that does not in itself prove anything. (2) Mrs.\\r\\nSilverdale obviously led him on and continually disappointed him. This\\r\\nfits in with the hypothesis I made. (3) His remark: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly I shall know\\r\\nof my triumph,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agrees very neatly with the memory-blotting property\\r\\nof hyoscine. As a whole, then, the hypothesis, seems justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Markfield, I notice he makes a parade of intense reluctance if\\r\\nhe is asked to give evidence involving Silverdale; but when he is\\r\\nactually induced to talk, he says things which tell heavily against\\r\\nhis colleague. As he's by no means a fool, this seems worth attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that the moneylender might wish to ensure that young\\r\\nHassendean's death should be proved to be due to murder; but I doubt\\r\\nif a firm doing so well (as appears from their office, which\\r\\nFlamborough describes as opulent) would be likely to go the length of\\r\\nmurder itself for the sake of a mere \\xc2\\xa35,000. And if Spratton had no\\r\\nhand in the actual murder, it is hard to see how he could get the\\r\\nfirst news of it. On the face of things, it's unlikely that he was\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And it is practically impossible to fit him into the affair\\r\\nat Heatherfield, which is interlocked with the bungalow tragedy.\\r\\nRenard's story of Mrs. Silverdale's inheritance may have some bearing\\r\\non the affair\\xe2\\x80\\x94but only if Silverdale is the murderer; and that won't\\r\\nfit in with the Heatherfield business on any reasonable assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne point certainly tells badly against Silverdale's credibility. He\\r\\nmust have told a deliberate lie when he said that on the night of the\\r\\nbungalow murder he was working late at the Croft-Thornton Institute.\\r\\nThis tale seems completely exploded by the evidence which Flamborough\\r\\nunearthed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale, however, is not necessarily a murderer because he has been\\r\\ntrapped in a lie. He may have used his lie to cover up something quite\\r\\nother than murder; and since he was obviously being suspected of\\r\\nmurder, his motive for lying must have been a strong one or he would\\r\\nhave made a clean breast of the affair. The only factor of sufficient\\r\\nimportance seems to be a woman whom he hoped to shield by his lie; and\\r\\nthe only woman in the case, so far, whom he has a clear interest in is\\r\\nMiss Deepcar. One can easily imagine circumstances in which he might\\r\\nfind it politic to lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the identification of hyoscine in the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I expected, hyoscine was the poison. That fits in with Hassendean's\\r\\njournal entry and with the hypothesis I made before. Hassendean, like\\r\\nmost people at the Croft-Thornton, had access to the hyoscine in the\\r\\nstore. The over-dose which he used gave me some trouble at first, but\\r\\nI think that's cleared up. All the available evidence shows that\\r\\nHassendean was a careless and inaccurate worker. From his notebook, I\\r\\nfound that he used the abbreviation _gr._ for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgramme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whereas\\r\\nMarkfield uses _gm._ It seems probable that Hassendean looked up the\\r\\nnormal dose of hyoscine in a book of reference, found it given in\\r\\napothecaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 weights as \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1/100 gr.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and copied this down as it\\r\\nstood, without making a note to remind him that here _gr._ meant\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgramme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When he came to weigh out the dose he meant\\r\\nto give to Mrs. Silverdale, he would read \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1/100 gr.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as _the\\r\\nhundredth part of a gramme_, since in laboratory work the metric\\r\\nsystem is always used and chemists never think in terms of grains.\\r\\nThus Hassendean, weighing out what in his carelessness he supposed to\\r\\nbe a normal dose, would take 0.01 _grammes_ of hyoscine. (The\\r\\nreference books state that serious poisoning has been caused by as\\r\\nlittle as 0.0002 gramme of hyoscine). As there are fifteen grains in a\\r\\ngramme, his quantity would be fifteen times the normal dose, which\\r\\nfits fairly well with the amount found in the body. He had no reason\\r\\nfor killing Mrs. Silverdale, provided that the hyoscine obliterated\\r\\nher memory of that evening's proceedings; and it seems most improbable\\r\\nthat he deliberately planned to cause her death.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hailsham obviously does not wish to see Hassendean's murderer\\r\\ncaught; and therefore her identification with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is more than\\r\\nproblematical. She may or may not have an alibi for the time of the\\r\\nbungalow affair, since she admits going to a dance in her car and\\r\\ncoming away almost immediately. One may keep her case in reserve for\\r\\nthe present.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield's car, GX.9074, is alleged to have been in an accident that\\r\\nnight. The man who complained about it might provide a clue to\\r\\nMarkfield's movements, if we can lay hands on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who appeared at Fountain Street Police Station, fishing for a\\r\\nreward in connection with the bungalow affair, can hardly be anyone\\r\\nbut one of the two watchers at the windows. Unfortunately, unless he\\r\\nchooses to talk, we have no power to extract information from him.\\r\\nFlamborough states that he can lay hands on him at any moment, as he\\r\\nis well known to our men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the receipt of the code advertisement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an ingenious fellow. First his trail was covered by\\r\\nusing letters clipped from telegraph forms; now he resorts to\\r\\nadvertisements, so that we do not get his handwriting. However, he\\r\\nbetrays his knowledge of the internal affairs of the Croft-Thornton,\\r\\nwhich is a bad mistake since it limits the circle of inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the interview with Renard.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't care much for Mr. Renard. He poses too much as the honest\\r\\nfellow rather puzzled by the course of events. His evidence, certainly\\r\\nsupplied a fresh motive for Silverdale in the r\\xc3\\xb4le of murderer. But\\r\\nSilverdale will not fit into the Heatherfield affair on any reasonable\\r\\nbasis; and the tragedies at Heatherfield and at the bungalow are\\r\\nobviously interconnected. It's a nuisance that Silverdale won't tell\\r\\nus where he spent the night of the murders. It might save trouble if\\r\\nhe did so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seems to be making a fool of himself. The fact that he\\r\\nforged Mrs. Silverdale's writing in the advertisement addresses limits\\r\\nthe circle still further. We now know: (_a_) that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must have\\r\\nlearned of the bungalow shooting almost as soon as it was done; (_b_)\\r\\nthat he knows hyoscine was in the Croft-Thornton stores; (_c_) that he\\r\\nis in possession of specimens of Mrs. Silverdale's writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield might fill the bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther possibles are: Miss Hailsham, Miss Deepcar, and Silverdale\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the Whalley murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Flamborough has let Whalley slip through our fingers!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy impression is that Whalley was murdered elsewhere and taken out in\\r\\na car to be dumped into the ditch where he was found. The man behind\\r\\nall this is clever, and wouldn't go in for an open-road murder in\\r\\nwhich he might be interrupted by a motorist coming round the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tourniquet was obviously intended to mislead us, or it would never\\r\\nhave been left beside the body. The Heatherfield tourniquet was a\\r\\nmakeshift thing which indicated no one in particular; this new one,\\r\\nwith its pressure-tubing and banjo-string, seems constructed specially\\r\\nas evidence. The tubing suggests the Croft-Thornton chemical work; the\\r\\nbanjo-string points to Silverdale, since I learned from Ringwood that\\r\\nSilverdale was a banjo-player. _Both these points would be familiar to\\r\\nMarkfield._\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laboratory coat was apparently left on its peg every night after\\r\\nwork was done. It was therefore accessible to anyone in the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton, after Silverdale had gone for the day. _Markfield\\r\\ncould have procured it, if necessary, and returned it when his work\\r\\nwith it was over._ If the Whalley murder was committed in some\\r\\nsecluded spot\\xe2\\x80\\x94say inside a house\\xe2\\x80\\x94the murderer would hardly have left a\\r\\nclue, like this button and shred of cloth, in his victim's hand, since\\r\\nhe would have plenty of time to search the body at leisure. As things\\r\\nare, it looks like a manufactured clue, especially since the shred of\\r\\ncloth is so characteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverdale again has no alibi; _but neither has Markfield_, since his\\r\\nhousekeeper was away nursing a relative. We shall need to wait for\\r\\nfurther evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the raid on Avice Deepcar's house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlamborough has arrested Silverdale. Perhaps it's a sound move, though\\r\\nnot from his point of view. I hope it will bring things to a crisis,\\r\\nand that we may be able to fish something out of the disturbed waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne point is already established: Silverdale had nothing to do with\\r\\nthis raid on Miss Deepcar's house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raider must have been a man. Miss Deepcar herself could not have\\r\\nimpersonated me well enough to deceive her own maid. Miss Hailsham has\\r\\na girl's figure and could hardly have posed as myself. The shape of\\r\\nher face, and especially her mouth, would make that impossible. No\\r\\nother woman that we know about is sufficiently mixed up in the\\r\\nbusiness to make it worth while to run a risk like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Markfield, according to Ringwood's evidence, used to go in for\\r\\namateur theatricals. Further, Markfield knew\\xe2\\x80\\x94for he told me so at the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton\\xe2\\x80\\x94that Miss Deepcar was out of town on the night of the\\r\\nraid on her house_, so if he was the raider, he could be sure that he\\r\\nwouldn't have to meet her and run the risk of meeting (_a_) a person\\r\\nwho knew him when undisguised; and (_b_) a person who knew my\\r\\nappearance well enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was he after? Letters, evidently. And again this limits the\\r\\ncircle, since the raider must be someone who has knowledge of the\\r\\nrelations between Silverdale and Miss Deepcar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Deepcar's evidence gives Silverdale a complete alibi for the time\\r\\nof the bungalow murder. On the other hand, they may both have been\\r\\nmixed up in it; in which case her evidence carries no weight. But the\\r\\nHeatherfield affair seems the key to the whole business, and\\r\\nSilverdale had no motive for that murder, even assuming he wanted to\\r\\ndestroy the draft of his wife's new will. On the face of it, Miss\\r\\nDeepcar's evidence seems sound and clears Silverdale.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten after the receipt of the photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious how people will never let well alone. If this fellow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhad been content to stay out of the case, we'd have had a much stiffer\\r\\njob. Now at last he's let us see what side he's on\\xe2\\x80\\x94anti-Silverdale\\r\\ndefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photographs are obvious fakes if one examines them carefully.\\r\\nTheir only importance is as a guide to the identity of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJustice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey limit the circle still further, since the production of them\\r\\nimplies the use of a good microphotographic camera; and the\\r\\nCroft-Thornton Institute has more than one of these.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Points which seem to tell against Markfield:\\r\\n\\r\\n  (1) He was intimate with Mrs. Silverdale shortly after she came\\r\\n    here.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (2) He was near Heatherfield on the night of the murder.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (3) He knew the maid was alone in Heatherfield except for her sick\\r\\n    companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (4) He could easily have obtained possession of Silverdale's\\r\\n    cigarette-holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (5) Owing to his housekeeper's absence, he could move about freely\\r\\n    with no check on the times when he left his house or returned to\\r\\n    it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (6) He was out at the Research Station on the Lizardbridge Road\\r\\n    early in the evening on the night of the bungalow affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (7) The evidence he gave us, for all his pretence of reluctance, was\\r\\n    directed against Silverdale.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (8) He was well acquainted with all the arrangements of the\\r\\n    Croft-Thornton Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (9) Owing to his earlier association with Mrs. Silverdale, he had\\r\\n    access to specimens of her writing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (10) His car's number, GX.9074, was known to Whalley, who made\\r\\n    inquiries about it with reference to the night of the murders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (11) He knew that Silverdale had a banjo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (12) He had access to Silverdale's laboratory coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (13) He knew of the relations between Silverdale and Miss Deepcar.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (14) He knew that Miss Deepcar would be out of town on the night\\r\\n    when the raid was made on her house.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (15) He was a good amateur actor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (16) He had access to a microphotographic camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are established facts. Make the assumption that his earlier\\r\\nassociation with Mrs. Silverdale was a guilty and not an innocent one,\\r\\nand see where that leads. It suggests the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_a_) That they took special care to conceal their intimacy, since\\r\\n    Silverdale would have been glad of a divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_b_) That they themselves did not wish for a divorce, possibly for\\r\\n    financial reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_c_) That Hassendean was utilised as a shield for the real\\r\\n    intrigue, without understanding that he was serving this purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_d_) That he took the bit in his teeth and resorted to hyoscine to\\r\\n    gain his ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_e_) That Markfield, on his way home from the Research Station that\\r\\n    night, caught a glimpse of Hassendean driving Mrs. Silverdale out\\r\\n    to the bungalow, and became suspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_f_) That he followed them and the tragedy ensued.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_g_) That after the tragedy, Markfield realised the danger of his\\r\\n    love-letters to Mrs. Silverdale which were in her room at\\r\\n    Heatherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n  (_h_) That the Heatherfield murder followed as a sequel to this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there is the inscription in the ring which Mrs. Silverdale\\r\\nwore. Markfield has no initial \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in his name; but the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d might\\r\\nstand for some pet name which she used for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe net result of it all is that there are strong grounds for\\r\\nsuspicion against him, but no real proof that one could put\\r\\nconfidently before a jury.\\r\\n\\r\\nPossibly he might be bluffed. I'll try it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten some time after the explosion at Markfield's house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne might put it down as a drawn game. We failed to hang Markfield,\\r\\nfor the explosion killed him on the spot. Luckily, the effects were\\r\\nextraordinarily localised, and Flamborough and I got off alive, though\\r\\nbadly damaged temporarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkfield, one has to admit, was too clever for us at the last. From\\r\\nwhat a chemist has since told me, tetranitromethane detonates with\\r\\nextraordinary violence in presence of triethylamine, though it is\\r\\nperfectly safe to handle under normal conditions. Markfield had about\\r\\nhalf a pound or more of tetranitromethane in his conical flask; in his\\r\\ndropping funnel he had alcohol, or some other harmless liquid,\\r\\ncolourless like triethylamine; and in his stoppered bottle he had\\r\\ntriethylamine itself. While he talked to us, he ran the alcohol into\\r\\nthe tetranitromethane\\xe2\\x80\\x94a perfectly harmless operation. Then, when he\\r\\nsaw the game was up, he ran the funnel empty and refilled it from the\\r\\nbottle. As we saw it, this was simply a preparation for continuing the\\r\\nexperiment which we had already found to be harmless; but in practice\\r\\nit meant that he had only to turn his tap and mix the two liquids in\\r\\norder to get his explosion. He staged it so well that neither\\r\\nFlamborough nor I spotted what he was after.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was a perfect wreck, they tell me: doors and windows blown\\r\\nout, ceilings down, walls cracked. The room we were in was completely\\r\\ngutted by the explosion; and Markfield was torn in pieces. I didn't\\r\\nsee it, of course. The next thing I remember was waking up in a\\r\\nnursing home. Possibly it was cheap at the price of getting rid of\\r\\nMarkfield. He was a good specimen of the callous murderer. The only\\r\\nsoft spot in him seems to have been his passion for Yvonne Silverdale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscriber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Note\\r\\n\\r\\nThis transcription follows the text of the first edition published by\\r\\nVictor Gollancz Ltd. in 1928.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"}"
